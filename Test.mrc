Along with his contemporaries Callimachus and Theocritus, Apollonius refashioned Greek poetry to meet the interests and aesthetics of a Hellenistic audience, especially that of Alexandria in the Ptolemaic period following Alexander's death. In this carefully crafted work of 5,835 hexameter verses in four books, the author draws on the preceding literary traditions of epic (Homer), lyric (Pindar), and tragedy (especially Euripides) but creates an innovative and complex narrative that includes geography, religion, ethnography, mythology, adventure, exploration, human psychology, and, most of all, the coming of age and love affair of Jason and Medea. It greatly influenced Roman authors such as Catullus, Virgil, and Ovid, and was imitated by Valerius Flaccus.

He died during the reign of Antoninus Pius who was emperor 138-161 CE. Honest admirer of the Roman empire though ignorant of the institutions of the earlier Roman republic, he wrote, in the simple "common" dialect, 24 books of "Roman affairs," in fact conquests, from the beginnings to the times of Trajan (emperor 98-117 CE). Eleven have come down to us complete, or nearly so, namely those on the Spanish, Hannibalic, Punic, Illyrian, Syrian, and Mithridatic wars, and five books on the Civil Wars.

Tibullus (c. 54-19 BCE) proclaims love for "Delia" and "Nemesis" in elegy. The beautiful verse of the Pervigilium Veneris (fourth century CE?) celebrates a spring festival in honour of the goddess of love.bCatullus (Gaius Valerius, 84-54 BCE), of Verona, went early to Rome, where he associated not only with other literary men from Cisalpine Gaul but also with Cicero and Hortensius. His surviving poems consist of nearly sixty short lyrics, eight longer poems in various metres, and almost fifty epigrams. All exemplify a strict technique of studied composition inherited from early Greek lyric and the poets of Alexandria. In his work we can trace his unhappy love for a woman he calls Lesbia; the death of his brother; his visits to Bithynia; and his emotional friendships and enmities at Rome. For consummate poetic artistry coupled with intensity of feeling Catullus's poems have no rival in Latin literature. Tibullus (Albius, ca. 54-19 BCE), of equestrian rank and a friend of Horace, enjoyed the patronage of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, whom he several times apostrophizes. Three books of elegies have come down to us under his name, of which only the first two are authentic. Book 1 mostly proclaims his love for "Delia," Book 2 his passion for "Nemesis." The third book consists of a miscellany of poems from the archives of Messalla; it is very doubtful whether any come from the pen of Tibullus himself. But a special interest attaches to a group of them which concern a girl called Sulpicia: some of the poems are written by her lover Cerinthus, while others purport to be her own composition. The Pervigilium Veneris, a poem of not quite a hundred lines celebrating a spring festival in honour of the goddess of love, is remarkable both for its beauty and as the first clear note of romanticism which transformed classical into medieval literature. The manuscripts give no clue to its author, but recent scholarship has made a strong case for attributing it to the early fourth-century poet Tiberianus.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aTibullusvTranslations into English.10aCatullus, Gaius ValeriusvTranslations into English. 0aElegiac poetry, LatinxTranslations into English. 0aLatin poetryxTranslations into English. 0aLove poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 7aElegiac poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)907836.2fast 7aLatin poetry0(OCoLC)993373.2fast 7aLove poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)1002912.2fast 0aRomevPoetry. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast 0aElegiac poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aEpigrams, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aLove poetry, LatinvTranslations into English.0 aTibullus,eauthor.1 aGoold, George Patrick,d1922-2001,eeditor,etranslator.12aMackail, J.

These letters, in this four-volume series, also provide a vivid picture of a momentous period in Roman history--years marked by the rise of Julius Caesar and the downfall of the Republic. When the correspondence begins in November 68 BCE the 38-year-old Cicero is a notable figure in Rome: a brilliant lawyer and orator, who has achieved primacy at the Roman bar and a political career that would culminate in the Consulship in 63. Over the next twenty-four years--to November 44, a year before he was put to death by the forces of Octavian and Mark Antony--Cicero wrote frequently to his friend and confidant, sharing news and discussing affairs of business and state. It is to this corpus of over 400 letters that we owe most of our information about Cicero's literary activity. And taken as a whole the letters provide a first-hand account of social and political life in Rome.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aAtticus, Titus PomponiusvCorrespondence.10aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tCorrespondence. 0aAuthors, LatinvCorrespondence. 0aLatin lettersvTranslations into English. 0aStatesmenzRomevCorrespondence. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aLatin letters0(OCoLC)993327.2fast 7aStatesmen0(OCoLC)1131990.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aShackleton Bailey, D.

Eighteen of his ninety or so plays survive complete, including Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae, one of the great masterpieces of the tragic genre. Fragments of his lost plays also survive.bOne of antiquity's greatest poets, Euripides (ca. 485-406 BCE) has been prized in every age for the pathos, terror, surprising plot twists, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations. Here, in the third volume of a new edition that is receiving much praise, are four of his plays. Suppliant Women reflects on war and on the rule of law. Euripides's Electra--presenting the famous legend of a brother and sister who seek revenge on their mother for killing their father--is a portrayal interestingly different from that of Aeschylus or Sophocles. Heracles shows the malice of the gods--and mutual loyalty as the human response to divinely sent disaster. David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text and a new translation that, in the words of Greece and Rome, is "close to the Greek and reads fluently and well."  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aEuripidesvTranslations into English. 0aGreek drama (Tragedy)vTranslations into English. 0aMythology, GreekvDrama. 7aGreek drama (Satyr play)0(OCoLC)947144.2fast 7aGreek drama (Tragedy)0(OCoLC)947146.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aMythology, Greek, in literature0(OCoLC)1031814.2fast 7aTragedy0(OCoLC)1154355.2fast02aEuripides,eauthor.tElectra.02aEuripides,eauthor.tHeracles.1 aKovacs, David,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aEuripides.tSuppliant women.

Here, in the third volume of a new edition that is receiving much praise, is the text and translation of three of his plays. Trojan Women, a play about the causes and consequences of war, develops the theme of the tragic unpredictability of life. Iphigenia among the Taurians and Ion exhibit tragic themes and situations (the murder of close relatives). Each ends happily with a joyful reunion. As in the first three volumes of this edition, David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text and an admired new translation that, in the words of Greece and Rome, is "close to the Greek and reads fluently and well;" his introduction to each play and explanatory notes offer readers judicious guidance.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aEuripidesxTranslations into English.00aHecuba,cQueen of TroyvDrama.00aIonc(Mythological character)vDrama.00aIphigeniac(Mythological character)vDrama. 0aGreek drama (Tragedy)xTranslations into English. 0aHecuba (Legendary character)xDrama. 0aIon (Greek mythology)xDrama. 0aIphigenia (Greek mythology)xDrama. 0aTrojan WarxDrama. 7aBacchantes0(OCoLC)825025.2fast 7aCassandra (Legendary character)0(OCoLC)848303.2fast 7aHecuba (Legendary character)0(OCoLC)954435.2fast 7aHelen of Troy (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)954545.2fast 7aQueens0(OCoLC)1085637.2fast 7aTurkeyzTroy (Extinct city)0(OCoLC)1896842.2fast02aEuripides,eauthor.tIphigenia among the Taurians.02aEuripides,eauthor.tIon.1 aKovacs, David,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aEuripides.tTrojan women.

In this fifth volume of the new Loeb Classical Library Euripides, David Kovacs presents a freshly edited Greek text and a faithful and deftly worded translation of three plays. For his Helen the poet employs an alternative history in which a virtuous Helen never went to Troy but spent the war years in Egypt, falsely blamed for the adulterous behavior of her divinely created double in Troy. This volume also includes Phoenician Women, Euripides' treatment of the battle between the sons of Oedipus for control of Thebes; and Orestes, a novel retelling of Orestes' lot after he murdered his mother, Clytaemestra.

Eighteen of his ninety or so plays survive complete, including Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae, one of the great masterpieces of the tragic genre. Fragments of his lost plays also survive.bEuripides of Athens (ca. 485-406 BCE), famous in every age for the pathos, terror, surprising plot twists, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations, wrote nearly ninety plays. Of these, eighteen (plus a play of unknown authorship mistakenly included with his works) have come down to us from antiquity. In this first volume of a new Loeb edition of Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text of three plays and an accurate and graceful translation with explanatory notes. Alcestis is the story of a woman who agrees, in order to save her husband's life, to die in his place. Medea is a tragedy of revenge in which Medea kills her own children, as well as their father's new wife, to punish him for his desertion. The volume begins with Cyclops, a satyr play--the only complete example of this genre to survive. Each play is preceded by an introduction. In a general introduction Kovacs demonstrates that the biographical tradition about Euripides--parts of which view him as a subverter of morality, religion, and art--cannot be relied on. He argues that this tradition has often furnished the unacknowledged starting point for interpretation, and that the way is now clear for an unprejudiced consideration of the plays themselves.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAlcestis,cQueen, consort of Admetus, King of PheraevDrama.00aEuripidesvTranslations into English.00aMedea,cconsort of Aegeus, King of Athens (Mythological character)vDrama. 0aAlcestis (Greek mythology)vDrama. 0aCyclopes (Greek mythology)vDrama. 0aGreek drama (Tragedy)vTranslations into English. 0aMedea (Greek mythology)vDrama. 7aGreek drama (Satyr play)0(OCoLC)947144.2fast 7aGreek drama (Tragedy)0(OCoLC)947146.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aMythology, Greek, in literature0(OCoLC)1031814.2fast 7aTragedy0(OCoLC)1154355.2fast0 aGreek drama02aEuripides,eauthor.tAlcestis.02aEuripides,eauthor.tMedea.1 aKovacs, David,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aEuripides.tCyclops.

Born and educated in Constantinople as a Christian, after a precarious childhood he devoted himself to literature and philosophy and became a pagan, studying in various Greek cities. In 355 his cousin Emperor Constantius called him from Athens to the court at Milan, entitled him Caesar, and made him governor of Gaul. Julian restored Gaul to prosperity and good government after the ravages of the Alamanni (he overthrew them at the battle of Strassburg in 357) and other Germans. Between 357 and 361 Julian's own soldiers, refusing to serve in the East at Constantius's orders, nearly involved Julian in war with Constantius--who however died in 361 so that Julian became sole Emperor of the Roman world. He began many reforms and proclaimed universal toleration in religion but pressed for the restoration of the older pagan worships. In 362-363 he prepared at Constantinople and then at Antioch for his expedition against Persia ruled by Shapur II. He died of a wound received in desperate battle. Julian's surviving works (lost are his Commentaries on his western campaigns), all in Greek, are given in the Loeb Classical Library in three volumes. The eight Orations (1-5 in Volume I, 6-8 in Volume II) include two in praise of Constantius, one praising Constantius's wife Eusebia, and two theosophical hymns (in prose) or declamations, of interest for studies in neo-Platonism, Mithraism, and the cult of the Magna Mater in the Roman world. The satirical Caesars and Misopogon, Beard-hater, are also in Volume II. The Letters (more than eighty, Volume III) include edicts or rescripts, mostly about Christians, encyclical or pastoral letters to priests, and private letters. Lastly in Volume III are the fragments of the work Against the Galilaeans (the Christians), written mainly to show that evidence for the idea of Christianity is lacking in the Old Testament.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., GreekvTranslations into English. 7aManners and customs0(OCoLC)1007815.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aCanada0(OCoLC)1204310.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aWright, Wilmer Cave,etranslator.08iPrint version:aJulian, Emperor of Rome, 331-363.sWorks.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1913z9780674990142(v.1)z9780674990326(v.2)z9780674991736(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v13, 29, 157.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL013/1913/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL029/1913/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL157/1923/volume.xml06662nam a22006734a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341020004100382035002100423040001200444041001800456050002300474072002300497100003500520243002800555245008100583260005400664300002200718490006200740500011200802504004100914505189000955520170802845538003604553546006004589588004704649600002604696650001904722650003704741650004304778650007404821650003204895650003304927650004104960651003405001700004905035700002905084700003205113776026005145830006305405856006505468856006505533856006505598856006505663856006505728856006505793856006505858856006505923hup0000114MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1913    mau    gob    00| e eng d  z9780674990159q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990609q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674991446q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674991798q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674993334q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674994744q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674994751q(v. 7)qprint version  z9780674994768q(v. 8)qprint version  a(OCoLC)741480669  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.L835 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aLucian,cof Samosata,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Greek10aLucianh[electronic resource] /cwith an English translation by A.M.

Late in life he fell on hard times and accepted an official post in Egypt. Although notable for the Attic purity and elegance of his Greek and his literary versatility, Lucian is chiefly famed for the lively, cynical wit of the humorous dialogues in which he satirizes human folly, superstition, and hypocrisy. His aim was to amuse rather than to instruct. Among his best works are A True Story (the tallest of tall stories, about a voyage to the moon) and The Carousal or Symposium (philosophers misbehave at a party) (both in Loeb Classical Library volume no. 14); Dialogues of the Gods (a reductio ad absurdum of traditional mythology) and Dialogues of the Dead (on the vanity of human wishes) (both in Loeb no. 431); Philosophies for Sale (great philosophers of the past are auctioned off as slaves) and Timon (the problems of being rich) (Loeb no. 54); The Fisherman (the degeneracy of modern philosophers) and Twice Accused (Lucian’s defense of his literary career) (Loeb no. 130); and, if by Lucian, The Ass (the amusing adventures of a man who is turned into an ass) (Loeb no. 432).  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aLucian,cof Samosata. 0aSatire, Greek. 7aCourtesans0(OCoLC)881707.2fast 7aDialogues, Greek0(OCoLC)892521.2fast 7aGreek language, Hellenistic (300 B.C.-600 A.D.)0(OCoLC)947344.2fast 7aLove0(OCoLC)1002769.2fast 7aMagic0(OCoLC)1005468.2fast 7aSatire, Greek0(OCoLC)1105722.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aHarmon, A.

The Apocolocyntosis (Pumpkinification), a satire on the death and apotheosis of the emperor Claudius, is attributed to Seneca (c. 4 BCE-54 CE).bPetronius (C. or T. Petronius Arbiter), who is reasonably identified with the author of this famous satyric and satiric novel, was a man of pleasure and of good literary taste who flourished in the times of Claudius (41-54 CE) and Nero (54-68). As Tacitus describes him, he used to sleep by day, and attend to official duties or to his amusements by night. At one time he was governor of the province of Bithynia in Asia Minor and was also a consul, showing himself a man of vigour when this was required. Later he lapsed into indulgence (or assumed the mask of vice) and became a close friend of Nero. Accused by jealous Tigellinus of disloyalty and condemned, with self-opened veins he conversed lightly with friends, dined, drowsed, sent to Nero a survey of Nero's sexual deeds, and so died, 66 CE. The surviving parts of Petronius's romance Satyricon mix philosophy and real life, prose and verse, in a tale of the disreputable adventures of Encolpius and two companions, Ascyltus and Giton. In the course of their wanderings they attend a showy and wildly extravagant dinner given by a rich freedman, Trimalchio, whose guests talk about themselves and life in general. Other incidents are a shipwreck and somewhat lurid proceedings in South Italy. The work is written partly in pure Latin, but sometimes purposely in a more vulgar style. It parodies and otherwise attacks bad taste in literature, pedantry and hollow society. Apocolocyntosis, Pumpkinification (instead of deification), is probably by Seneca the wealthy philosopher and courtier (ca. 4 BCE-65 CE). It is a medley of prose and verse and a political satire on the Emperor Claudius written soon after he died in 54 CE and was deified.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aSatire, Latin. 7aSatire, Latin0(OCoLC)1105743.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus,dapproximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.eauthor.tApocolocyntosis.1 aHeseltine, Michael,etranslator.tSatyricon.1 aRouse, W.

Eusebius's reply to Hierocles.  aIn his Life of Apollonius Philostratus (second to third century CE) portrays a first-century CE teacher, religious reformer, and perceived rival to Jesus. Apollonius's letters, ancient reports about him, and a letter by Eusebius (fourth century CE) that is now central to the history of Philostratus's work add to the portrait.bThis biography of a first-century CE holy man has become one of the most widely discussed literary works of later antiquity. With an engaging style, Philostratus portrays a charismatic teacher and religious reformer from Tyana in Cappadocia (modern central Turkey) who travels across the known world, from the Atlantic to the Ganges. His miracles, which include extraordinary cures and mysterious disappearances, together with his apparent triumph over death, caused pagans to make Apollonius a rival to Jesus of Nazareth. In a new three-volume Loeb Classical Library edition of Philostratus's third-century work, Christopher Jones provides a freshly edited Greek text and a stylish translation with full explanatory notes. Apollonius of Tyana is by far the longest biography that survives from antiquity. Jones in his Introduction asks how far it is history and how far fiction, and discusses its survival from Late Antiquity to modern times.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aApollonius,cof TyanavEarly works to 1800. 0aPhilosopherszGreecevBiographyvEarly works to 1800. 7aChristianity0(OCoLC)859599.2fast 7aPhilosophers0(OCoLC)1060746.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aJones, Christopher P.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPhilostratus, the Athenian, active 2nd century-3rd century.tApollonius of Tyana.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2005z9780674996137(v.1)z9780674996144(v.2)z9780674996175(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v16-17, 458.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL016/2005/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL017/2005/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL458/2006/volume.xml03170nam a22004694a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002500179072002300204072002300227100003300250240003000283245008800313260005400401300002200455490003400477504003700511520135200548538003601900546006001936588004701996650005402043650002702097650005102124650002402175650004302199650004802242650004602290650005102336651004102387700006102428776011602489830003502605856006002640hup0000118MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1990    mau    gob    00| p eng d  z9780674990203qprint version  a(OCoLC)555882935  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6645.E5bP767 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPOE0080002bisacsh1 aPropertius, Sextus,eauthor.10aElegiae.lEnglish & Latin10aElegiesh[electronic resource] /cPropertius ; edited and translated by G.P.

Here he portrays the exciting, uneven course of his love affair with Cynthia and tells us much about his contemporaries and the society in which he lives, while in later poems he turns to mythological themes and the legends of early Rome. In this new edition of Propertius, G. P. Goold solves some longstanding questions of interpretation and gives us a faithful and stylish prose translation. His explanatory notes and glossary/index offer steady guidance and a wealth of information. Born in Assisi about 50 BCE, Sextus Propertius moved as a young man to Rome, where he came into contact with a coterie of poets, including Virgil, Tibullus, Horace, and Ovid. Publication of his first book brought immediate recognition and the unwavering support of Maecenas, the influential patron of the Augustan poets. He died perhaps in his mid-thirties, leaving us four books of elegies that have attracted admirers throughout the ages.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aElegiac poetry, LatinxTranslations into English. 0aElegiac poetry, Latin. 0aLove poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aLove poetry, Latin. 0aMan-woman relationshipszRomevPoetry. 7aElegiac poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)907836.2fast 7aLove poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)1002912.2fast 7aMan-woman relationships0(OCoLC)1007080.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aGoold, George Patrick,d1922-2001,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPropertius, Sextus.tElegies.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1990z9780674990203 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v18.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL018/1990/volume.xml02747nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100005500271245010800326260005400434300002200488490003400510504003900544520095800583538003601541546006001577588004701637650005201684650002501736650004501761650004301806651003401849651006001883651005501943700006301998776014502061830003502206856006002241hup0000119MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1913    mau    gob    00| p eng d  z9780674990227qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735263  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.Q568 2014 7aHIS0020002bisacsh 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aQuintus,cSmyrnaeus,dactive 4th century,eauthor.14aThe Fall of Troyh[electronic resource] /cQuintus Smyrnaeus ; with an English translation by A.S.

Seven complete plays are extant, including Oedipus Tyrannus, Ajax, Antigone, and Philoctetes. Among many fragments that also survive is a substantial portion of the satyr drama The Searchers.bSophocles (497/6-406 BCE), with Aeschylus and Euripides, was one of the three great tragic poets of Athens, and is considered one of the world's greatest poets. The subjects of his plays were drawn from mythology and legend. Each play contains at least one heroic figure, a character whose strength, courage, or intelligence exceeds the human norm--but who also has more than ordinary pride and self-assurance. These qualities combine to lead to a tragic end. Hugh Lloyd-Jones gives us, in two volumes, a new translation of the seven surviving plays. Volume I contains Oedipus Tyrannus (which tells the famous Oedipus story), Ajax (a heroic tragedy of wounded self-esteem), and Electra (the story of siblings who seek revenge on their mother and her lover for killing their father). Volume II contains Oedipus at Colonus (the climax of the fallen hero's life), Antigone (a conflict between public authority and an individual woman's conscience), The Women of Trachis (a fatal attempt by Heracles' wife to regain her husband's love), and Philoctetes (Odysseus's intrigue to bring an unwilling hero to the Trojan War). Of his other plays, only fragments remain; but from these much can be learned about Sophocles' language and dramatic art. The major fragments--ranging in length from two lines to a very substantial portion of the satyr play The Searchers--are collected in Volume III of this edition. In prefatory notes Lloyd-Jones provides frameworks for the fragments of known plays.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aSophoclesxTranslations into English. 0aGreek drama (Tragedy)xTranslations into English. 0aMythology, GreekxDrama. 7aAntigone (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)810528.2fast 7aGreek drama (Tragedy)0(OCoLC)947146.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aPhiloctetes (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1060679.2fast0 aGreek drama1 aLloyd-Jones, Hugh,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aSophocles.sWorks.bRev.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1994z9780674995574(v.1)z9780674995581(v.2)z9780674995321(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v20-21, 483.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL020/1994/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL021/1994/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL483/1996/volume.xml03308nam a22004094a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251100002200274243002800296245009300324260005400417300002200471490003700493505011400530520164500644538003602289546006002325588004702385600004002432650004702472650004302519700004002562776012802602830003802730856006502768856006502833hup0000122MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2001    mau    go     00| d eng d  z9780674995970q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995987q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)605300298  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.T474 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aTerence,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Latin14aTerenceh[electronic resource] /cedited and with an English translation by John Barsby.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v22-230 av.

They include Phormio, a comedy of intrigue and trickery; The Brothers, which explores parental education of sons; and The Eunuch, which presents the most sympathetically drawn courtesan in Roman comedy.bTerence brought to the Roman stage a bright comic voice and a refined sense of style. His six comedies--first produced in the half dozen years before his premature death in 159 BCE--were imaginatively reformulated in Latin plays written by Greek playwrights, especially Menander. For this new Loeb Classical Library edition of Terence, John Barsby gives us a faithful and lively translation with full explanatory notes, facing a freshly edited Latin text. Volume I contains a substantial introduction and three plays: The Woman of Andros, a romantic comedy; The Self-Tormentor, which looks at contrasting father-son relationships; and The Eunuch, whose characters include the most sympathetically drawn courtesan in Roman comedy. The other three plays are in Volume II: Phormio, a comedy of intrigue with an engaging trickster; The Mother-in-Law, unique among Terence's plays in that the female characters are the admirable ones; and The Brothers, which explores contrasting approaches to parental education of sons. The Romans highly praised Terence--"whose speech can charm, whose every word delights," in Cicero's words. This new edition of his plays, which replaces the now outdated Loeb translation by John Sargeaunt (first published in 1912), succeeds in capturing his polished style and appeal.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aTerencevTranslations into English. 7aLatin drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)993105.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast1 aBarsby, John,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aTerence.sWorks.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2001z9780674995970(v.1)z9780674995987(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v22-23.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL022/2001/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL023/2001/volume.xml03463nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002100228072002300249072002300272072002300295245009300318260005400411300002200465490003700487500002000524505016000544520155300704538003602257546006002293588004702353650007502400650004802475650002702523650005402550650006902604700004202673776013402715830003802849856006502887856006502952hup0000124MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2003    mau    go     00| 0ceng d  z9780674996076q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674996083q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)603637666  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aBR60b.E376 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aREL0150002bisacsh 7aREL0330002bisacsh04aThe Apostolic fathersh[electronic resource] /cedited and translated by Bart D.

Some of them were accorded almost Scriptural authority in the early Church. This new Loeb edition of these essential texts reflects current idiom and the latest scholarship. Here are the Letters of Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, among the most famous documents of early Christianity; these letters, addressing core theological questions, were written to a half dozen different congregations while Ignatius was en route to Rome as a prisoner, condemned to die in the wild-beast arena. Also in this collection is a letter to the Philippian church by Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna and friend of Ignatius, as well as an account of Polycarp's martyrdom. There are several kinds of texts in the Apostolic Fathers collection, representing different religious outlooks. The manual called the Didache sets forth precepts for religious instruction, worship, and ministry. The Epistle of Barnabas searches the Old Testament, the Jewish Bible, for testimony in support of Christianity and against Judaism. Probably the most widely read in the early Christian centuries was The Shepherd of Hermas, a book of revelations that develops a doctrine of repentance.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aChristian literature, EarlyxGreek authorsvTranslations into English. 0aChristian literature, EarlyxGreek authors. 0aFathers of the church. 7aChristian literature, Early0(OCoLC)859261.2fast 7aChristian literature, EarlyxGreek authors0(OCoLC)859264.2fast1 aEhrman, Bart D.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:tThe apostolic fathers.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2003z9780674996076(v.1)z9780674996083(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v24-25.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL024/2003/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL025/2003/volume.xml04053nam a22005294a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274100004900297240003500346245005300381260005400434300002200488490003700510504003700547505013600584520168400720538003602404546006002440588004702500600004002547650008502587650007202672650008502744650006402829650003402893650004302927650003602970651003703006651005703043700004903100700004603149776016003195830003803355856006503393856006503458hup0000126MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2014    mau    gob    00| 0aeng d  z9780674996854q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674994539q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198761  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aBR65.A6bA948 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aAugustine,cSaint, Bishop of Hippo,eauthor.10aConfessiones.lEnglish & Latin10aConfessionsh[electronic resource] /cAugustine.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v26-27  aIncludes bibliography and index.0 av.

Cast as a prayer addressed to God, it offers a gripping personal story and a philosophical exploration destined to have broad and lasting impact.bAurelius Augustine (354-430 CE), one of the most important figures in the development of western Christianity and philosophy, was the son of a pagan, Patricius of Tagaste, and his Christian wife, Monnica. While studying to become a rhetorician, he plunged into a turmoil of philosophical and psychological doubts, leading him to Manichaeism. In 383 he moved to Rome and then Milan to teach rhetoric. Despite exploring classical philosophical systems, especially skepticism and neoplatonism, his studies of Paul's letters with his friend Alypius, and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose, led in 386 to his momentous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He soon returned to Tagaste and founded a religious community, and in 395 or 396 became Bishop of Hippo.  Confessions, composed ca. 397, is a spiritual autobiography of Augustine's early life, family, personal and intellectual associations, and explorations of alternative religious and theological viewpoints as he moved toward his conversion. Cast as a prayer addressed to God, though always conscious of its readers, Confessions offers a gripping personal story and a philosophical exploration destined to have broad and lasting impact, all delivered with Augustine's characteristic brilliance as a stylist.  This edition replaces the earlier Loeb Confessions by William Watts.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAugustine,cSaint, Bishop of Hippo. 0aBishopszAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)xBishopsvBiographyvEarly works to 1800. 0aCatholic ChurchzAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)xBishopsvBiography. 0aChristian saintszAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)vBiographyvEarly works to 1800. 0aChristian saintszAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)vBiography. 7aBishops0(OCoLC)833378.2fast 7aChristian saints0(OCoLC)859491.2fast 7aTheology0(OCoLC)1149559.2fast 0aHippo (Extinct city)vBiography. 7aAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)0(OCoLC)1896881.2fast1 aHammond, Carolyn J.-B.eeditor,etranslator.1 aWatts, William,d1590?-1649,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAugustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo.tConfessions.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2014z9780674996854(v.1)z9780674994539(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v26-27.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL026/2014/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL027/1912/volume.xml03673nam a22004574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225245012700248260005400375300002200429490003400451504003700485520192100522538003602443546006002479588004702539650004502586650002802631650003902659650003902698650005202737650005002789651003402839700002502873700004402898700002202942700004902964776010703013830003503120856006003155hup0000128MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1912    mau    gob    00| p eng d  z9780674990319qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735524  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3611b.T446 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPOE0080002bisacsh00aGreek bucolic poetsh[electronic resource] : bTheocritus ; Bion ; Moschus /cwith an English translation by J.M.

The extant poems of Moschus (second century BCE) and Bion (probably second and first centuries BCE) are not really bucolic, but Bion's Lament for Adonis is floridly brilliant. Pattern poems are found in the Greek Anthology, a work of many centuries.bTheocritus of the third century BCE, born at Syracuse, travelled widely in the Greek world. Having studied poetry at Cos with poet and critic Philitas, he composed poetry under patronage, chiefly perhaps at Syracuse and Cos; and then went to Alexandria in Egypt, whose King Ptolemy II (died 246 BCE), pupil of Philitas, befriended him. Here (and at Cos?) he spent the rest of his life. Most lovable of Greek versemakers, Theocritus was the founder of bucolic or pastoral poetry. Of his so-called "Idylls," "little forms" or pieces (not all are genuine), ten are about pastoral life real or idealised; several are small epics (three are hymns); two are beautiful "occasional" poems (one about a country walk, one to accompany a gift of a distaff for the wife of his friend Nicias); six are love-poems; several are mimes, striking pictures of common life; and three are specially expressive of his own feelings. The 24 "Epigrams" were apparently inscribed on works of art. Moschus of Syracuse, 2nd century BCE, came next. As a grammarian he wrote a (lost) work on Rhodian dialect. Though he was classed as bucolic, his extant poetry (mainly Runaway Love and the story of Europa) is not really pastoral, the Lament for Bion not being Moschus's work. Megara may be by Theocritus; but The Dead Adonis is much later. Bion of Phlossa near Smyrna lived in Sicily, probably late 2nd and early 1st century BCE. Most of the extant poems are not really bucolic, but Lament for Adonis is floridly brilliant. The so-called "Pattern-Poems," included in the bucolic tradition, are found also in the Greek Anthology.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek poetryxTranslations into English. 0aPastoral poetry, Greek. 7aCountry life0(OCoLC)881405.2fast 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 7aGreek poetry, Hellenistic0(OCoLC)947510.2fast 7aPastoral poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)1054648.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast0 aTheocritus,eauthor.0 aBion,cof Phlossa near Smyrna,eauthor.0 aMoschus,eauthor.1 aEdmonds, J.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEthicsvEarly works to 1800. 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aEthics, Ancient0(OCoLC)915866.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aPhilosophy0(OCoLC)1060777.2fast 7aRoman law0(OCoLC)1099759.2fast1 aMiller, Walter,d1864-1949,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tOn duties.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1913z9780674990333 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v30.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL030/1913/volume.xml03965nam a22005294a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274100006100297245010600358250005100464260005400515300003900569490003800608504003700646505029900683520150900982538003602491546006002527588004702587650002002634650004102654650003602695650003502731650004302766650004002809650003702849651002102886651004402907651004102951700003902992700004803031776018703079830003903266856006503305856006503370hup0000131MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1914    mauj   gob    00| 0ceng d  z9780674995703q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995659q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198762  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6700b.S848 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aSuetonius,dapproximately 69-approximately 122,eauthor.10aLives of the Caesarsh[electronic resource] /cSuetonius ; with an English translation by J.C.

Lives of Pliny the Elder and Passienus Crispus.  aEnriched by anecdotes, gossip, and details of character and personal appearance, Lives of the Caesars by Suetonius (born c. 70 CE) is a valuable and colorful source of information about the first twelve Roman emperors, Roman imperial politics, and Roman imperial society. Part of Suetonius' Lives of Illustrious Men (of letters) also survives.bSuetonius (C. Suetonius Tranquillus, born ca. 70 CE), son of a military tribune, was at first an advocate and a teacher of rhetoric, but later became the emperor Hadrian's private secretary, 119-121. He dedicated to C. Septicius Clarus, prefect of the praetorian guard, his Lives of the Caesars. After the dismissal of both men for some breach of court etiquette, Suetonius apparently retired and probably continued his writing. His other works, many known by title, are now lost except for part of the Lives of Illustrious Men (of letters). Friend of Pliny the Younger, Suetonius was a studious and careful collector of facts, so that the extant lives of the emperors (including Julius Caesar the dictator) to Domitian are invaluable. His plan in Lives of the Caesars is: the emperor's family and early years; public and private life; death. We find many anecdotes, much gossip of the imperial court, and various details of character and personal appearance. Suetonius's account of Nero's death is justly famous. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Suetonius is in two volumes. Both volumes were revised throughout in 1997-98, and a new Introduction added.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEmperorszRome. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aBiography0(OCoLC)832149.2fast 7aEmperors0(OCoLC)908898.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aPoets, Latin0(OCoLC)1067972.2fast 7aRoman law0(OCoLC)1099759.2fast 0aRomevBiography. 0aRomexHistoryyEmpire, 30 B.C.-284 A.D. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aBradley, K.

Dio's work is a vital source for the last years of the Roman republic and the first four Roman emperors.bDio Cassius (Cassius Dio), ca. 150- 235 CE, was born at Nicaea in Bithynia in Asia Minor. On the death of his father (Roman governor of Cilicia) he went in 180 to Rome, entered the Senate, and under the emperor Commodus was an advocate. He held high offices, becoming a close friend of several emperors. He was made governor of Pergamum and Smyrna; consul in 220; proconsul of Africa; governor of Dalmatia and then of Pannonia; and consul again in 229. Of the eighty books of Dio's great work Roman History, covering the era from the legendary landing of Aeneas in Italy to the reign of Alexander Severus (222-235 CE), we possess Books 36-60 (36 and 55-60 have gaps), which cover the years 68 BCE-47 CE. The missing portions are partly supplied, for the earlier gaps by Zonaras, who relies closely on Dio, and for some later gaps (Book 35 onwards) by John Xiphilinus (of the eleventh century).

Here is a new Loeb Classical Library edition of the great Roman poet's Odes and Epodes, a fluid translation facing the Latin text. Horace took pride in being the first Roman to write a body of lyric poetry. For models he turned to Greek lyric, especially to the poetry of Alcaeus, Sappho, and Pindar; but his poems are set in a Roman context. His four books of odes cover a wide range of moods and topics. Some are public poems, upholding the traditional values of courage, loyalty, and piety; and there are hymns to the gods. But most of the odes are on private themes: chiding or advising friends; speaking about love and amorous situations, often amusingly. Horace's seventeen epodes, which he called iambi, were also an innovation for Roman literature. Like the odes they were inspired by a Greek model: the seventh-century iambic poetry of Archilochus. Love and political concerns are frequent themes; here the tone is generally that of satirical lampoons. "In his language he is triumphantly adventurous," Quintilian said of Horace; this new translation reflects his different voices.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aHoracevTranslations into English. 0aLaudatory poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aVerse satire, LatinvTranslations into English. 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aLatin poetry0(OCoLC)993373.2fast 7aLaudatory poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)993519.2fast 7aOdes, Latin0(OCoLC)1740722.2fast 7aVerse satire, Latin0(OCoLC)1165504.2fast 0aRomevPoetry. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aRudd, Niall,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aHorace.tOdes and epodes.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2004z9780674996090 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v33.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL033/2004/volume.xml04039nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100004000271245013400311260005400445300002200499490003400521500002000555520216200575538003602737546006002773588004702833600005002880600003102930650002302961650004402984650004803028650004503076650003403121650003503155651003303190700004803223700005703271776013403328830003503462856006003497hup0000134MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1914    mau    go     00| f eng d  z9780674990388qprint version  a(OCoLC)606434993  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPR2065b.J646 2014 7aLCO0030002bisacsh 7aREL0070102bisacsh 7aREL0150002bisacsh0 aJohn,cof Damascus, Saint,eauthor.10aBarlaam and Ioasaphh[electronic resource] /cJohn Damascene ; with an English translation by G.R.

Though often attributed to John Damascene (c. 676-749 CE), it was probably translated from Georgian into Greek in the eleventh century CE.bOne of the best known examples of the hagiographic novel, this is the tale of an Indian prince who becomes aware of the world's miseries and is converted to Christianity by the monk Barlaam. Barlaam and Josaphat (Ioasaph) were believed to have re-converted India after her lapse from conversion to Christianity, and they were numbered among the Christian saints. Centuries ago likenesses were noticed between the life of Josaphat and the life of the Buddha; the resemblances are in incidents, doctrine, and philosophy, and Barlaam's rules of abstinence resemble the Buddhist monk's. But not till the mid-nineteenth century was it recognised that, in Josaphat, the Buddha had been venerated as a Christian saint for about a thousand years. The origin of the story of Barlaam and Ioasaph--which in itself has little peculiar to Buddhism--appears to be a Manichaean tract produced in Central Asia. It was welcomed by the Arabs and by the Georgians. The Greek romance of Barlaam appears separately first in the 11th century. Most of the Greek manuscripts attribute the story to John the Monk, and it is only some later scribes who identify this John with John Damascene (ca. 676-749). There is strong evidence in Latin and Georgian as well as Greek that it was the Georgian Euthymius (who died in 1028) who caused the story to be translated from Georgian into Greek, the whole being reshaped and supplemented. The Greek romance soon spread throughout Christendom, and was translated into Latin, Old Slavonic, Armenian, and Arabic. An English version (from Latin) was used by Shakespeare in his caskets scene in The Merchant of Venice. David M. Lang's Introduction traces parallels between the Buddhist and Christian legends, discusses the importance of Arabic versions, and notes influences of the Manichaean creed.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aGautama BuddhavLegendsvEarly works to 1800.00aJohn,cof Damascus, Saint. 0aChristian legends. 7aBuddhist legends0(OCoLC)1727608.2fast 7aChristian hagiography0(OCoLC)859164.2fast 7aChristian legends0(OCoLC)1727967.2fast 7aLegends0(OCoLC)995592.2fast 7aPrinces0(OCoLC)1076481.2fast 7aIndia0(OCoLC)1210276.2fast1 aMattingly, Harold,d1884-1964,etranslator.1 aWoodward, George Ratcliffe,d1848-1934,etranslator.08iPrint version:aJohn, of Damascus, Saint.tBarlaam and Ioasaph.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1914z9780674990388 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v34.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL034/1914/volume.xml04108nam a22006374a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259035002100300040001200321041001800333050002300351072002300374072002300397100003300420243002800453245003600481260005400517300004600571490005400617500002200671505063800693520074701331538003602078546006002114588004702174650004302221650004402264650003402308650003702342651003602379651005202415651003502467651004102502700006402543700004602607700004402653700005502697700004402752700004802796700004702844776019902891830005503090856006503145856006503210856006503275856006503340856006503405hup0000135MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1914    maub   go     00| 0beng d  z9780674990395q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674991231q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674992740q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674993457q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674993556q(v. 5)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198764  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.T335 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aTacitus, Cornelius,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Latin10aTacitush[electronic resource].  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource :bmaps, table of dates1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v35, 111, 249, 312, 322  aIncludes indexes.00gv.

He became an orator, married in 77 a daughter of Julius Agricola before Agricola went to Britain, was quaestor in 81 or 82, a senator under the Flavian emperors, and a praetor in 88. After four years' absence he experienced the terrors of Emperor Domitian's last years and turned to historical writing. He was a consul in 97. Close friend of the younger Pliny, with him he successfully prosecuted Marius Priscus. Tacitus is renowned for his development of a pregnant concise style, character study, and psychological analysis, and for the often terrible story which he brilliantly tells. As a historian of the early Roman empire he is paramount.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aGermanic peoples0(OCoLC)942049.2fast 7aOratory, Ancient0(OCoLC)1047223.2fast 7aRomans0(OCoLC)1100116.2fast 7aStatesmen0(OCoLC)1131990.2fast 0aRomexHistoryyFlavians, 69-96. 0aRomexHistoryyJulio-Claudians, 30 B.C.-68 A.D. 7aGermany0(OCoLC)1210272.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aWarmington, E.

Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.

Iulius, 102-44 BCE), statesman and soldier, defied the dictator Sulla; served in the Mithridatic wars and in Spain; pushed his way in Roman politics as a "democrat" against the senatorial government; was the real leader of the coalition with Pompey and Crassus; conquered all Gaul for Rome; attacked Britain twice; was forced into civil war; became master of the Roman world; and achieved wide-reaching reforms until his murder. We have his books of Commentarii (notes): eight on his wars in Gaul, 58-52 BC, including the two expeditions to Britain 55-54, and three on the civil war of 49-48. They are records of his own campaigns (with occasional digressions) in vigorous, direct, clear, unemotional style and in the third person, the account of the civil war being somewhat more impassioned. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Caesar is in three volumes. Volume I is his Gallic War. The Alexandrian War, the African War and the Spanish War, commonly ascribed to Caesar by our manuscripts but of uncertain authorship, are collected in Volume III.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aGenerals0(OCoLC)939841.2fast 7aHeads of state0(OCoLC)952677.2fast 7aLatin language0(OCoLC)993125.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 0aRomexHistoryyCivil War, 49-45 B.C. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aPeskett, A.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGood and evilvEarly works to 1800. 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aEthics, Ancient0(OCoLC)915866.2fast 7aGood and evil0(OCoLC)944894.2fast 7aStoics0(OCoLC)1133750.2fast1 aRackham, H.q(Harris),d1868-1944,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tOn ends.bRev.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1914z9780674990449 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v40.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL040/1914/volume.xml03430nam a22004934a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202100004700225245010500272250003800377260005400415300002200469490003400491500002000525520142200545538003601967546006002003588004702063600006502110650005102175650002402226650001902250650004802269650005102317650004602368650004002414650005102454650004802505650003302553700006102586700004702647776014702694830003502841856006002876hup0000141MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1914    mau    go     00| p eng d  z9780674990456qprint version  a(OCoLC)904378415  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.O953 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D.eauthor.10aHeroidesh[electronic resource] ; bAmores /cOvid ; with an English translation by Grant Showerman.  aNew ed. /brevised by G.P.

Lucius wants the sensations of a bird, but by pharmaceutical accident becomes an ass. The bulk of the novel recounts his adventures as an animal, but Lucius also recounts many stories he overhears, including that of Cupid and Psyche.bIn the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, also known as The Golden Ass, we have the only Latin novel which survives entire. It is truly enchanting: a delightful romance combining realism and magic. The hero, Lucius, eager to experience the sensations of a bird, resorts to witchcraft but by an unfortunate pharmaceutical error finds himself transformed into an ass. He knows he can revert to his own body by eating rose-petals, but these prove singularly elusive; and the bulk of the work describes his adventures as an animal. He also retails many stories that he overheard, the most charming being that of Cupid and Psyche (beginning, in true fairy-tale fashion, "Erant in quadam civitate rex et regina"). Some of the stories are as indecent as they are witty, and two in the ninth book were deemed by Boccaccio worthy of inclusion in the Decameron. At last the goddess Isis takes pity on Lucius. In a surprising denouement, he is restored to human shape and, now spiritually regenerated, is initiated into her mysteries. The author's baroque Latin style nicely matches his fantastic narrative and is guaranteed to hold a reader's attention from beginning to end. J. Arthur Hanson was at the time of his death in 1985 Giger Professor of Latin at Princeton University. His publications include Roman Theater-Temples. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Apuleius is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aLatin fictionxTranslations into English. 0aMetamorphosisxFiction. 0aMythology, ClassicalxFiction. 7aLatin fiction0(OCoLC)993119.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aMetamorphosis0(OCoLC)1018264.2fast 7aMythology, Classical0(OCoLC)1031758.2fast1 aHanson, John Arthur,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aApuleius.tMetamorphoses (the golden ass).dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1996z9780674990494(v.1)z9780674994980(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v44, 453.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL044/1996/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL453/1989/volume.xml02550nam a22003974a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100003000248245011400278260005400392300002200446490003400468500002000502520104000522538003601562546006001598588004701658650005201705650002501757650004701782650004701829700005301876776012801929830003502057856006002092hup0000145MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1969    mau    go     00| f eng d  z9780674990500qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735321  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3819b.A245 2014 7aLCO0030002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aAchilles Tatius,eauthor.10aLeucippe and Clitophonh[electronic resource] /cAchilles Tatius ; with an English translation by S.

Achilles Tatius' style is notable for descriptive detail and for his engaging digressions.bAchilles Tatius was a Greek from Alexandria in Egypt; he is now believed to have flourished in the second century CE. Of his life nothing is known, though the Suidas says he became a Christian and a bishop and wrote a work on etymology, one on the sphere, and an account of great men. He is famous however for his surviving novel in eight books, The Adventures of Leucippe and Clitophon, one of the best Greek love stories. Clitophon relates to a friend the various difficulties which he and Leucippe had to overcome before they are happily united. The story is full of incident and readers are kept in suspense. There are many digressions giving scientific facts, myths, meditations, and so on, the interest of which redeems irrelevance.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aLove stories, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aLove stories, Greek. 7aLove stories, Greek0(OCoLC)1003021.2fast 7aRomances, Byzantine0(OCoLC)1099905.2fast1 aGaselee, S.q(Stephen),d1882-1943,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAchilles Tatius.tLeucippe and Clitophon.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1969z9780674990500 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v45.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL045/1969/volume.xml05141nam a22006494a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341020004100382020004100423020004200464020004200506035002100548040001200569041001800581050002000599072002300619072002300642100002300665245009700688260005400785300002200839490005700861504004100918505069800959520140301657538003603060546006003096588004703156651004603203651004403249651003403293651004103327700003703368776031103405830005803716856006503774856006503839856006503904856006503969856006504034856006504099856006504164856006504229856006504294856006604359856006604425hup0000146MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1914    mau    gob    00| 0ceng d  z9780674990524q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990531q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674990722q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674990890q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674990975q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674991095q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674991101q(v. 7)qprint version  z9780674991118q(v. 8)qprint version  z9780674991125q(v. 9)qprint version  z9780674991132q(v. 10)qprint version  z9780674991149q(v. 11)qprint version  a(OCoLC)904378372  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aDE7b.P588 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aPlutarch,eauthor.10aLivesh[electronic resource] /cPlutarch ; with an English translation by Bernadotte Perrin.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v46-47, 65, 80, 87, 98-103  aIncludes bibliographies and indexes.0 av.

His forty-six Parallel Lives are biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs, one Greek figure and one similar Roman, though the last four lives are single. They not only record careers and illustrious deeds but also offer rounded portraits of statesmen, orators, and military leaders.bPlutarch (Plutarchus), ca. 45-120 CE, was born at Chaeronea in Boeotia in central Greece, studied philosophy at Athens, and, after coming to Rome as a teacher in philosophy, was given consular rank by the emperor Trajan and a procuratorship in Greece by Hadrian. He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned. Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 Parallel Lives, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators. Plutarch's many other varied extant works, about 60 in number, are known as Moralia or Moral Essays. They are of high literary value, besides being of great use to people interested in philosophy, ethics and religion. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the Lives is in eleven volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreece xBiography vEarly works to 1800. 0aRome xBiography vEarly works to 1800. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aPerrin, Bernadotte,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPlutarch.tLives.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1914z9780674990524(v.1)z9780674990531(v.2)z9780674990722(v.3)z9780674990890(v.4)z9780674990975(v.5)z9780674991095(v.6)z9780674991101(v.7)z9780674991118(v.8)z9780674991125(v.9)z9780674991132(v.10)z9780674991149(v.11) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v46-47, 65, 80, 87, 98-103.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL046/1914/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL047/1914/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL065/1916/volume.xml403v.4uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL080/1916/volume.xml403v.5uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL087/1917/volume.xml403v.6uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL098/1918/volume.xml403v.7uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL099/1919/volume.xml403v.8uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL100/1919/volume.xml403v.9uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL101/1920/volume.xml403v.10uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL102/1921/volume.xml403v.11uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL103/1926/volume.xml05060nam a22006614a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341035002100382040001200403041001800415050002300433072002300456072002300479100002400502243002800526245008400554260005400638300003700692490006300729500005700792504003700849505037100886520176501257538003603022546006003058588004703118600005103165650002903216650003903245650003403284650003203318650003503350651005303385651002703438651004103465651004403506700005603550700004303606776023003649830006403879856006503943856006504008856006504073856006504138856006504203856006504268856006504333hup0000148MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1914    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674990548q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990906q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674991194q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674991910q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674992399q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674993204q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674993785q(v. 7)qprint version  a(OCoLC)747116798  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.P763 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aProcopius,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Greek10aProcopiush[electronic resource] /cwith an English translation by H.B.

General index.  aHistory of the Wars by the Byzantine historian Procopius (late fifth century to after 558 CE) consists largely of sixth century CE military history, with much information about peoples, places, and special events. Powerful description complements careful narration. Procopius is just to the empire's enemies and boldly criticises emperor Justinian.bProcopius, born at Caesarea in Palestine late in the 5th century, became a lawyer. In 527 CE he was made legal adviser and secretary of Belisarius, commander against the Persians, and went with Belisarius again in 533 against the Vandals and in 535 against the Ostrogoths. Sometime after 540 he returned to Constantinople. He may have been that Procopius who was prefect of Constantinople in 562, but the date of his death (after 558) is unknown. Procopius's History of the Wars in 8 books recounts the Persian Wars of emperors Justinus and Justinian down to 550 (2 books); the Vandalic War and after-events in Africa 532-546 (2 books); the Gothic War against the Ostrogoths in Sicily and Italy 536-552 (3 books); and a sketch of events to 554 (1 book). The whole consists largely of military history, with much information about peoples and places as well, and about special events. He was a diligent, careful, judicious narrator of facts and developments and shows good powers of description. He is just to the empire's enemies and boldly criticises emperor Justinian. Other works by Procopius are the Anecdota or Secret History--vehement attacks on Justinian, Theodora, and others; and The Buildings of Justinian (down to 558 CE) including roads and bridges as well as churches, forts, hospitals, and so on in various parts of the empire. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Procopius is in seven volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aJustinianbI,cEmperor of the East,d483?-565. 0aArchitecture, Byzantine. 0aGothszItalyvEarly works to 1800. 0aVandalsvEarly works to 1800. 7aGoths0(OCoLC)945091.2fast 7aVandals0(OCoLC)1164062.2fast 0aByzantine EmpirexHistoryyJustinian I, 527-565. 0aIranxHistoryyTo 640. 0aItalyxHistoryyGothic War, 535-555. 7aByzantine Empire0(OCoLC)1209292.2fast1 aDewing, H.

General index.  aIn his seventeen-book Geography, Strabo (c. 64 BCE-c. 25 CE) discusses geographical method, stresses the value of geography, and draws attention to the physical, political, and historical details of separate countries. Geography is a vital source for ancient geography and informative about ancient geographers.bStrabo (ca. 64 BCE to ca. 25 CE), an Asiatic Greek of Amasia in Pontus, studied at Nysa and after 44 BCE at Rome. He became a keen traveller who saw a large part of Italy, various near eastern regions including the Black Sea, various parts of Asia Minor, Egypt as far as Ethiopia, and parts of Greece. He was a long time in Alexandria where he no doubt studied mathematics, astronomy, and history. Strabo's historical work is lost, but his most important Geography in seventeen books has survived. After two introductory books, numbers 3 and 4 deal with Spain and Gaul, 5 and 6 with Italy and Sicily, 7 with north and east Europe, 8-10 with Greek lands, 11-14 with the main regions of Asia and with Asia Minor, 15 with India and Iran, 16 with Assyria, Babylonia, Syria, and Arabia, 17 with Egypt and Africa. In outline he follows the great mathematical geographer Eratosthenes, but adds general descriptions of separate countries including physical, political, and historical details. A sequel to his historical memoirs, Geography is planned apparently for public servants rather than students--hence the accounts of physical features and of natural products. On the mathematical side it is an invaluable source of information about Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and Posidonius. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Strabo is in eight volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGeography, Ancient. 7aClassical geography0(OCoLC)863484.2fast 7aGeography0(OCoLC)940469.2fast 7aGeography, Ancient0(OCoLC)940567.2fast1 aJones, Horace Leonard,d1879-etranslator.1 aSterrett, J.

Books 5-8.  aCyropaedia by Xenophon (c. 430-c. 354 BCE) is a historical romance on the education of the sixth century BCE Persian king Cyrus the Elder that reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government.bXenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE) was a wealthy Athenian and friend of Socrates. He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this "March Up-Country" (Anabasis); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth. Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. Hellenica, a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In Memorabilia Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's Symposium portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and Oeconomicus has him giving advice on household management and married life. Cyropaedia, a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes. We also have his Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon (on the Spartan system); Ways and Means (on the finances of Athens); Manual for a Cavalry Commander; a good manual of Horsemanship; and a lively Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aCyrus,cthe Great, King of Persia,d-530 B.C. or 529 B.C. 7aCivilization0(OCoLC)862898.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aIran0(OCoLC)1204889.2fast1 aMiller, Walter,d1864-1949,etranslator.08iPrint version:aXenophon.tCyropaedia.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1914z9780674990579(v.1)z9780674990999(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v51-52.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL051/1914/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL052/1914/volume.xml04089nam a22005174a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274100003400297245010300331260005400434300005000488490003800538504003700576505005500613520200100668538003602669546006002705588004702765600005202812600002502864600003902889650003602928650002802964650004602992650003503038650004103073650004003114650003403154651004103188700003203229776014103261830003903402856006503441856006503506hup0000155MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1969    maub   gob    00| i eng d  z9780674990616q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990661q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198800  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.P556 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aPliny,cthe Younger,eauthor.10aLettersh[electronic resource] /cPliny the Younger ; with an English translation by Betty Radice.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource :bmaps, line illustrations1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v55, 59  aIncludes bibliography and index.0 av.

The Panegyricus is an expanded, published version of Pliny's oration of thanks to the Emperor Trajan in 100 CE.bThe Younger Pliny was born in 61 or 62 CE, the son of Lucius Caecilius of Comum (Como) and the Elder Pliny's sister. He was educated at home and then in Rome under Quintilian. He was at Misenum at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 (described in two famous letters) when the Elder Pliny died. Pliny started his career at the Roman bar at the age of eighteen. He moved through the regular offices in a senator's career, held two treasury appointments and a priesthood, and was consul in September and October 100. On this occasion he delivered the speech of thanks to the Emperor Trajan which he afterwards expanded and published as the Panegyricus. After his consulship he returned to advocacy in the court and Senate, and was also president of the Tiber Conservancy Board. His hopes of retirement were cut short when he was chosen by Trajan to go out to the province of Bithynia and Pontus on a special commission as the Emperor's direct representative. He is known to have been there two years, and is presumed to have died there before the end of 113. Book X of the Letters contains his correspondence with Trajan during this period, and includes letters about the early Christians. Pliny's Letters are important as a social document of his times. They tell us about the man himself and his wide interests, and about his many friends, including Tacitus, Martial and Suetonius. Pliny has a gift for description and a versatile prose style, and more than any of his contemporaries he gives an unprejudiced picture of Rome as he knew it. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Pliny the Younger is in two volumes; the second contains Books VIII-X of his Letters and Panegyricus.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aPliny,cthe YoungerxTranslations into English.00aPliny,cthe Younger.00aTrajan,cEmperor of Rome,d53-117. 0aAuthors, LatinvCorrespondence. 0aLatin lettersvSources. 0aLatin lettersvTranslations into English. 0aLawyerszRomevCorrespondence. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aLatin letters0(OCoLC)993327.2fast 7aLawyers0(OCoLC)994346.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aRadice, Betty,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPliny, the Younger.tLetters.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1969z9780674990616(v.1)z9780674990661(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v55, 59.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL055/1969/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL059/1969/volume.xml03968nam a22005174a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002500228072002300253072002300276100002100299243002800320245007900348260005400427300003000481490003900511500002000550505008700570520190700657538003602564546006002600588004702660600003102707600002702738600005602765600003902821650003602860650003202896650003902928650005002967650005103017651003403068700005103102776012703153830004003280856006503320856006503385hup0000156MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1997    mau    go     00| p eng d  z9780674995642q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995345q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)645845762  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA4275.E5bP563 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aPindar,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Greek10aPindarh[electronic resource] /cedited and translated by William H.

Nemean odes. Isthmian odes.

The esteem of the ancients may help explain why a good portion of his work was carefully preserved. Most of the Greek lyric poets come down to us only in bits and pieces, but nearly a quarter of Pindar's poems survive complete. William H. Race now brings us, in two volumes, a new edition and translation of the four books of victory odes, along with surviving fragments of Pindar's other poems. Like Simonides and Bacchylides, Pindar wrote elaborate odes in honor of prize-winning athletes for public performance by singers, dancers, and musicians. His forty-five victory odes celebrate triumphs in athletic contests at the four great Panhellenic festivals: the Olympic, Pythian (at Delphi), Nemean, and Isthmian games. In these complex poems, Pindar commemorates the achievement of athletes and powerful rulers against the backdrop of divine favor, human failure, heroic legend, and the moral ideals of aristocratic Greek society. Readers have long savored them for their rich poetic language and imagery, moral maxims, and vivid portrayals of sacred myths. Race provides brief introductions to each ode and full explanatory footnotes, offering the reader invaluable guidance to these often difficult poems.

His exact dates are unknown, but he has often been considered a younger contemporary of Homer. bIn Theogony Hesiod charts the history of the divine world, narrating the origin of the universe and the rise of the gods, from first beginnings to the triumph of Zeus, and reporting on the progeny of Zeus and of goddesses in union with mortal men. In Works and Days Hesiod shifts his attention to the world of men, delivering moral precepts and practical advice regarding agriculture, navigation, and many other matters; along the way he gives us the myths of Pandora and of the Golden, Silver, and other Races of Men. Also included are The Shield and extant fragments of other poems, including the Catalogue of Women, that were attributed to Hesiod in antiquity. None of these is now thought to be by Hesiod himself, but all have considerable literary and historical interest. The Catalogue of Women is a systematic presentation in five books of a large number of Greek legendary heroes and episodes, organized according to the genealogy of the heroes’ mortal mothers. The Shield provides a Hesiodic counterpoint to the shield of Achilles in the Iliad, with Heracles as the protagonist. The volume concludes with a comprehensive index to the complete edition.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aClassical literaturevTranslations into English. 0aFables, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aHero (Greek mythology)xPoetry. 0aHymns, Greek (Classical)vTranslations into English. 7aAgriculture0(OCoLC)801355.2fast 7aDidactic poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)893006.2fast 7aElegiac poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)907819.2fast 7aGods, Greek0(OCoLC)944264.2fast 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 7aReligious poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)1736148.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aMost, Glenn W.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aHesiod.sWorks.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2007z9780674996229(v.1)z9780674996236(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v57, 503.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL057/2007/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL503/2007/volume.xml03649nam a22005054a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002100179072002300200072002300223100005800246245008400304260005400388300002200442490003400464504005000498520174700548538003602295546006002331588004702391650003302438650001202471650003102483650001002514650002502524650003302549650004102582650004202623650003302665650003202698650003802730650004702768650003402815700005202849776014702901830003503048856006003083hup0000158MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1916    mau    gob    00| e eng d  z9780674990647qprint version  a(OCoLC)606428945  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aB580b.M373 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aMarcus Aurelius,cEmperor of Rome,d121-180,eauthor.10aMarcus Aureliush[electronic resource] /cedited and translated by C.R.

His ethical, religious, and existential reflections have endured as an expression of Stoicism, a text for students of that philosophy, and a guide to the moral life.bMarcus Aurelius (121-180 CE), Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher, born at Rome, received training under his guardian and uncle emperor Antoninus Pius (reigned 138-161), who adopted him. He was converted to Stoicism and henceforward studied and practised philosophy and law. A gentle man, he lived in agreement and collaboration with Antoninus Pius. He married Pius's daughter and succeeded him as emperor in March 161, sharing some of the burdens with Lucius Verus. Marcus's reign soon saw fearful national disasters from flood, earthquakes, epidemics, threatened revolt (in Britain), a Parthian war, and pressure of barbarians north of the Alps. From 169 onwards he had to struggle hard against the German Quadi, Marcomani, Vandals, and others until success came in 174. In 175 (when Faustina died) he pacified affairs in Asia after a revolt by Avidius. War with Germans was renewed during which he caught some disease and died by the Danube in March 180. The famous Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (not his title; he simply calls them "The matters addressed to himself") represents reflections written in periods of solitude during the emperor's military campaigns. Originally intended for his private guidance and self-admonition, the Meditations has endured as a potent expression of Stoic belief. It is a central text for students of Stoicism as well as a unique personal guide to the moral life.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEthicsvEarly works to 1800. 0aEthics. 0aLifevEarly works to 1800. 0aLife. 0aPhilosophy, Ancient. 0aStoicsvEarly works to 1800. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aConduct of life0(OCoLC)874563.2fast 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aLife0(OCoLC)1198505.2fast 7aPhilosophy0(OCoLC)1060777.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aStoics0(OCoLC)1133750.2fast1 aHaines, Charles Reginald,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aMarcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, 121-180.tMarcus Aurelius.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1916z9780674990647 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v58.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL058/1916/volume.xml03622nam a22005294a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259035002100300040001200321041001800333050002300351072002300374072002300397100003700420243002800457245008100485260005400566300002200620490005200642504003700694505038400731520095001115538003602065546006002101588004702161600005502208600005802263650004702321655002502368655005302393700006502446776020302511830005302714856006502767856006502832856006502897856006502962856006503027hup0000160MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2011    mau    gob    00| d eng d  z9780674996533q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674996786q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674996823q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674999862q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674996816q(v. 5)qprint version  a(OCoLC)902695288  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.P538 2014 7aDRA0060002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aPlautus, Titus Maccius,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Latin10aPlautush[electronic resource] /cedited and translated by Wolfgang de Melo.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v60-61, 163, 260, 328  aIncludes bibliography and index.0 av.

Here is the first of a new two-volume edition of Seneca's tragedies, with a fully annotated translation facing the Latin text. Seneca's plays depict intense passions and interactions in an appropriately strong rhetoric. Their perspective is much bleaker than that of his prose writings. In this new translation John Fitch conveys the force of Seneca's dramatic language and the lyric quality of his choral odes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus,dapproximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.vTranslations into English. 0aMythology, ClassicalvDrama. 7aLatin drama (Tragedy)0(OCoLC)993112.2fast 7aLatin drama0(OCoLC)993101.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aMythology, Classical0(OCoLC)1031758.2fast1 aFitch, John G.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, approximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.tTragedies.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2002z9780674996021(v.1)z9780674990852(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v62, 78.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL062/2002/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL078/2004/volume.xml04225nam a22005894a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274100002100297243002800318245011500346250003800461260005400499300002200553490003700575500002000612505009900632520171900731538003602450546006002486588004702546600003902593650003102632650003202663650005502695650005102750650002702801650005502828650005502883650003802938650003902976650004903015650004503064650005003109651004103159700007003200700006103270776013603331830003803467856006503505856006503570hup0000163MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1999    mau    go     00| p eng d  z9780674995833q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995864q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)606591954  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.V574 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPOE0080002bisacsh0 aVirgil,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Latin10aVirgilh[electronic resource] /cwith an English translation by H.

Poems of the Appendix Vergiliana are traditionally, but in most cases probably wrongly, attributed to Virgil.bVirgil (Publius Vergilius Maro) was born in 70 BCE near Mantua and was educated at Cremona, Milan and Rome. Slow in speech, shy in manner, thoughtful in mind, weak in health, he went back north for a quiet life. Influenced by the group of poets there, he may have written some of the doubtful poems included in our Virgilian manuscripts. All his undoubted extant work is written in his perfect hexameters. Earliest comes the collection of ten pleasingly artificial bucolic poems, the Eclogues, which imitated freely Theocritus's idylls. They deal with pastoral life and love. Before 29 BCE came one of the best of all didactic works, the four hooks of Georgics on tillage, trees, cattle, and bees. Virgil's remaining years were spent in composing his great, not wholly finished, epic the Aeneid, on the traditional theme of Rome's origins through Aeneas of Troy. Inspired by the Emperor Augustus's rule, the poem is Homeric in metre and method but influenced also by later Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and learning, and deeply Roman in spirit. Virgil died in 19 BCE at Brundisium on his way home from Greece, where he had intended to round off the Aeneid. He had left in Rome a request that all its twelve books should be destroyed if he were to die then, but they were published by the executors of his will. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Virgil is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aVirgilvTranslations into English. 0aAgriculturezRomevPoetry. 0aCountry lifezRomevPoetry. 0aDidactic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aEpic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aLegendszRomevPoetry. 0aPastoral poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 7aAeneas (Legendary character)0(OCoLC)798041.2fast 7aAgriculture0(OCoLC)801355.2fast 7aCountry life0(OCoLC)881405.2fast 7aDidactic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)893018.2fast 7aEpic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)913954.2fast 7aPastoral poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)1054657.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aFairclough, H.

To the collection (called "Stephanus," wreath or garland) made and contributed to by Meleager of Gadara (1st century BCE) was added another by Philippus of Thessalonica (late 1st century CE), a third by Diogenianus (2nd century), and much later a fourth, called the "Circle," by Agathias of Myrina. These (lost) and others (also lost) were partly incorporated, arranged according to contents, by Constantinus Cephalas (early 10th century?) into fifteen books now preserved in a single manuscript of the Palatine Library at Heidelberg. The grand collection was rearranged and revised by the monk Maximus Planudes (14th century) who also added epigrams lost from Cephalas's compilation. Outstanding among the poets are Meleager, Antipater of Sidon, Crinagoras, Palladas, Agathias, Paulus Silentiarius.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aGreek anthology. 0aEpigrams, GreekxHistory and criticism. 0aGreek poetryvTranslations into English. 0aGreek poetryvTranslations. 0aGreek poetry. 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 0aEpigrams, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aEpigrams, Greek.1 aPaton, W.

In the former Theophrastus classifies and describes. His On Odours and Weather Signs are minor treatises.bTheophrastus of Eresus in Lesbos, born about 370 BCE, is the author of the most important botanical works that have survived from classical antiquity. He was in turn student, collaborator, and successor of Aristotle. Like his predecessor he was interested in all aspects of human knowledge and experience, especially natural science. His writings on plants form a counterpart to Aristotle's zoological works. In the Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus classifies and describes varieties--covering trees, plants of particular regions, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and cereals; in the last of the nine books he focuses on plant juices and medicinal properties of herbs. The Loeb Classical Library edition is in two volumes; the second contains two additional treatises: On Odours and Weather Signs. In De Causis Plantarum Theophrastus turns to plant physiology. Books One and Two are concerned with generation, sprouting, flowering and fruiting, and the effects of climate. In Books Three and Four Theophrastus studies cultivation and agricultural methods. In Books Five and Six he discusses plant breeding; diseases and other causes of death; and distinctive flavours and odours. Theophrastus's celebrated Characters is of a quite different nature. This collection of descriptive sketches is the earliest known character-writing and a striking reflection of contemporary life.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aBotanyxPre-Linnean works. 7aBotany0(OCoLC)836869.2fast1 aHort, Arthur,cSir,d1864-1935,etranslator.08iPrint version:aTheophrastus.tEnquiry into plants.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1916z9780674990777(v.1)z9780674995239(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v70, 79.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL070/1916/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL079/1916/volume.xml02780nam a22004334a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100002000271240005000291245010600341260005400447300002200501490003400523504004800557520116300605538003601768546006001804588004701864650003101911650001601942650004501958650005302003650003802056700003702094776012002131830003502251856006002286hup0000171MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1916    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674990784qprint version  a(OCoLC)606406066  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3995b.G354 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aMED0390002bisacsh0 aGalen,eauthor.10aDe naturalibus facultatibus.lEnglish & Greek10aOn the natural facultiesh[electronic resource] /cGalen ; with an English translation by A.J.

It is in the form of Galenism that Greek medicine was transmitted to later ages.bIf the work of Hippocrates is taken as representing the foundation upon which the edifice of historical Greek medicine was reared, then the work of Galen, who lived some six hundred years later, may be looked upon as the summit of the same edifice. He was born in Pergamum 129 CE, and both there and in other academic centres of the Aegean pursued his medical studies before being appointed physician to the Pergamene gladiators in 157. Becoming dissatisfied with this type of practice he emigrated to Rome, where he soon won acknowledgement as the foremost medical authority of his time and where, with one brief interruption, he remained until his death in 199. Galen's merit is to have crystallised or brought to a focus all the best work of the Greek medical schools which had preceded his own time. It is essentially in the form of Galenism that Greek medicine was transmitted to after ages.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMedicine, Greek and Roman. 0aPhysiology. 7aMedicine, Ancient0(OCoLC)1015182.2fast 7aMedicine, Greek and Roman0(OCoLC)1015251.2fast 7aPhysiology0(OCoLC)1063177.2fast1 aBrock, Arthur John,etranslator.08iPrint version:aGalen.tOn the natural faculties.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1916z9780674990784 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v71.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL071/1916/volume.xml02895nam a22004214a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100002900248240003900277245009900316260005400415300005000469490003400519504003900553520124800592538003601840546006001876588004701936650005301983650004702036651003602083651004002119651004102159700005902200776011902259830003502378856006002413hup0000172MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1917    mauab  gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674990807qprint version  a(OCoLC)681148910  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.C347 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aCaesar, Julius,eauthor.10aDe bello Gallico.lEnglish & Latin14aThe Gallic warh[electronic resource] /cCaesar ; with an English translation by H.J.

We have his books of Commentarii (notes): eight on his wars in Gaul, 58-52 BC, including the two expeditions to Britain 55-54, and three on the civil war of 49-48. They are records of his own campaigns (with occasional digressions) in vigorous, direct, clear, unemotional style and in the third person, the account of the civil war being somewhat more impassioned. There is no rhetoric. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Caesar is in three volumes. Volume II is his Civil Wars. The Alexandrian War, the African War, and the Spanish War, commonly ascribed to Caesar by our manuscripts but of uncertain authorship, are collected in Volume III.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aMilitary history, Ancient0(OCoLC)1021234.2fast 7aMilitary leadership0(OCoLC)1185276.2fast 0aGaulxHistoryy58 B.C.-511 A.D. 7aEuropezGaul0(OCoLC)1240016.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aEdwards, H.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows: I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Aristotle is in twenty-three volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEthics. 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aEthics, Ancient0(OCoLC)915866.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast1 aRackham, H.q(Harris),d1868-1944,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAristotle.tNicomachean ethics.bRev.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1926z9780674990814 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v73.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL073/1926/volume.xml03701nam a22005294a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100003000271245018000301260005400481300002200535490003400557500002000591520150900611538003602120546006002156588004702216650001502263650002902278650005902307650003902366650003602405650005102441650003802492650004702530650004102577650003602618650005002654700006202704700005102766700006002817700004202877776015702919830003503076856006003111hup0000174MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1973    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674990838qprint version  a(OCoLC)705865763  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.B648 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh 7aREL0150002bisacsh0 aBoethius,d-524,eauthor.10aTheological tractatesh[electronic resource] /cBoethius ; translation by H.F.

His Tractates examine the Trinity and incarnation in Aristotelian terms. His Consolation of Philosophy, a dialogue between himself and Philosophy, is theistic in tone but draws on Greek, especially Neoplatonist, sources.bBoethius (Boetius)--Anicius Manlius Severinus--Roman statesman and philosopher (ca. 480-524 CE), was son of Flavius Manlius Boetius, after whose death he was looked after by several men, especially Memmius Symmachus. He married Symmachus's daughter, Rusticiana, by whom he had two sons. All three men rose to high honours under Theodoric the Ostrogoth, but Boethius fell from favour, was tried for treason, wrongly condemned, and imprisoned at Ticinum (Pavia), where he wrote his renowned The Consolation of Philosophy. He was put to death in 524, to the great remorse of Theodoric. Boethius was revered as if he were a saint and his bones were removed in 996 to the Church of S. Pietro in Ciel d'Oro, and later to the Cathedral. The tower in Pavia where he was imprisoned is still venerated. Boethius was author of Latin translations of Aristotle, commentaries on various philosophical works, original works on logic, five books on music, and other works. His The Consolation of Philosophy is the last example of purely literary Latin of ancient times-a mingling of alternate dialogue and poems. His Theological Tractates are also included in this volume.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aHappiness. 0aPhilosophy and religion. 0aTheologyxHistoryyEarly church, approximately 30-600. 7aChristianity0(OCoLC)859599.2fast 7aHappiness0(OCoLC)951160.2fast 7aPhilosophy and religion0(OCoLC)1060826.2fast 7aPhilosophy0(OCoLC)1060777.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aScholasticism0(OCoLC)1106919.2fast 7aTheology0(OCoLC)1149559.2fast 7aTheologyxEarly church0(OCoLC)1907238.2fast02aBoethius,d-524,eauthor.tThe consolation of philosophy.1 aRand, Edward Kennard,d1871-1945,etranslator.1 aStewart, H.

He thus presents a Stoic philosopher's thoughts about the good life in a contemporary context.bSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, born at Corduba (Cordova) ca. 4 BCE, of a prominent and wealthy family, spent an ailing childhood and youth at Rome in an aunt's care. He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle. We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)--on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness--and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, Apocolocyntosis (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost. The 124 epistles are collected in Volumes IV-VI of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus,dapproximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.xCorrespondence. 0aConduct of life. 0aEthics, Ancient. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aConduct of life0(OCoLC)874563.2fast 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aEthics, Ancient0(OCoLC)915866.2fast 7aLatin language0(OCoLC)993125.2fast 7aLatin letters0(OCoLC)993327.2fast1 aGummere, Richard M.q(Richard Mott),d1883-etranslator.08iPrint version:aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, approximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.tEpistles.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1917z9780674990845(v.1)z9780674996106(v.2)z9780674990869(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v75-77.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL075/1917/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL076/1920/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL077/1925/volume.xml03997nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274072002300297100002300320245010400343260005400447300002200501490003700523504003700560505004100597520227300638538003602911546006002947588004703007650003903054651002103093651003403114651003203148700007003180776013303250830003803383856006503421856006503486hup0000188MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1918    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674990982q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990586q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)756441038  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA4497b.X466 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aXenophon,eauthor.10aHellenicah[electronic resource] /cXenophon ; with an English translation by Carleton L.

He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this "March Up-Country" (Anabasis); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth. Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. Hellenica, a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In Memorabilia Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's Symposium portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and Oeconomicus has him giving advice on household management and married life. Cyropaedia, a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes. We also have his Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon (on the Spartan system); Ways and Means (on the finances of Athens); Manual for a Cavalry Commander; a good manual of Horsemanship; and a lively Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aCivilization0(OCoLC)862898.2fast 0aGreecexHistory. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aIran0(OCoLC)1204889.2fast1 aBrownson, Carleton L.q(Carleton Lewis),d1866-1948,etranslator.08iPrint version:aXenophon.tHellenica.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1918z9780674990982(v.1)z9780674990586(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v88-89.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL088/1918/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL089/1921/volume.xml04122nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100002300271245010300294250004000397260005400437300002900491490003400520504003700554520242000591538003603011546006003047588004703107600005803154650003903212651005103251651002703302651003403329651003203363700007003395776011603465830003503581856006003616hup0000190MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1998    maub   gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674991019qprint version  a(OCoLC)905183878  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA4497b.X466 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aXenophon,eauthor.10aAnabasish[electronic resource] /cXenophon ; with an English translation by Carleton L.

Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this "March Up-Country" (Anabasis); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth. Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. Hellenica, a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In Memorabilia Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's Symposium portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and Oeconomicus has him giving advice on household management and married life. Cyropaedia, a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes. We also have his Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon (on the Spartan system); Ways and Means (on the finances of Athens); Manual for a Cavalry Commander; a good manual of Horsemanship; and a lively Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aCyrus,cthe Younger,dapproximately 423 B.C.-401 B.C. 7aCivilization0(OCoLC)862898.2fast 0aGreecexHistoryyExpedition of Cyrus, 401 B.C. 0aIranxHistoryyTo 640. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aIran0(OCoLC)1204889.2fast1 aBrownson, Carleton L.q(Carleton Lewis),d1866-1948,etranslator.08iPrint version:aXenophon.tAnabasis.bNew ed.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1998z9780674991019 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v90.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL090/1998/volume.xml03155nam a22004574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100002200248245009800270260005400368300002200422490003400444500002200478520145500500538003601955546006001991588004702051600004002098600004002138650005202178650004302230650003402273650004702307651001802354651004102372700002202413700005002435776011702485830003502602856006002637hup0000191MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2004    mau    go     00| h eng d  z9780674996120qprint version  a(OCoLC)647676669  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.J884 2014 7aFOR0160002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aJuvenal,eauthor.10aJuvenal and Persiush[electronic resource] /cedited and translated by Susanna Morton Braund.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v91  aIncludes indexes.  aBite and wit characterize two seminal and stellar authors in the history of satirical writing, Persius (34-62 CE) and Juvenal (writing about sixty years later).

Persius (34-62 CE) and Juvenal (writing maybe 60 years later) were heirs to the style of Latin verse satire developed by Lucilius and Horace, a tradition mined in Susanna Braund's introduction and notes. Her notes also give guidance to the literary and historical allusions that pepper Persius's and Juvenal's satirical poems--which were clearly aimed at a sophisticated urban audience. Both poets adopt the mask of an angry man, and sharp criticism of the society in which they live is combined with flashes of sardonic humor in their satires. Whether targeting common and uncommon vices, the foolishness of prayers, the abuse of power by emperors and the Roman elite, the folly and depravity of Roman wives, or decadence, materialism, and corruption, their tone is generally one of righteous indignation. Juvenal and Persius are seminal as well as stellar figures in the history of satirical writing. Juvenal especially had a lasting influence on English writers of the Renaissance and succeeding centuries.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aJuvenalvTranslations into English.00aPersiusvTranslations into English. 0aVerse satire, LatinvTranslations into English. 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aSatire0(OCoLC)1105668.2fast 7aVerse satire, Latin0(OCoLC)1165504.2fast 0aRomevPoetry. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast0 aPersius,eauthor.1 aBraund, Susanna Morton,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aJuvenal.tJuvenal and Persius.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2004z9780674996120 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v91.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL091/2004/volume.xml03345nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100008300271245018600354260005400540300002200594490003400616504003900650520123800689538003601927546006001963588004702023650003902070650005302109650004702162651004002209651004102249700011002290700010702400700006202507776023502569830003502804856006002839hup0000192MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1919    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674991033qprint version  a(OCoLC)767562430  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA6156b.C546 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh 7aREL0150002bisacsh0 aClement,cof Alexandria, Saint,dapproximately 150-approximately 215,eauthor.14aThe exhortation to the Greeksh[electronic resource] ; bThe rich man's salvation ; To the newly baptized /cClement of Alexandria ; with an English translation by G.W.

His Exhortation to the Greeks to give up their gods and turn to Christ shows familiarity with the mystery cults. The "Rich Man's Salvation" is a homily that offers a glimpse of Clement's public teaching.bClement of Alexandria, famous Father of the Church, is known chiefly from his own works. He was born, perhaps at Athens, about 150 CE, son of non-Christian parents; he converted to Christianity probably in early manhood. He became a presbyter in the Church at Alexandria and there succeeded Pantaenus in the catechetical school; his students included Origen and Bishop Alexander. He may have left Alexandria in 202, was known at Antioch, was alive in 211, and was dead before 220. This volume contains Clement's Exhortation to the Greeks to give up gods for God and Christ; "Who Is the Man Who Is Saved?" (an exposition of Mark 10:17-31, concerning the rich man's salvation); and an exhortation To the Newly Baptized. Clement was an eclectic philosopher of a neo-Platonic kind who later found a new philosophy in Christianity, and studied not only the Bible but the beliefs of Christian heretics.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aWealthxMoral and ethical aspects. 7aMilitary history, Ancient0(OCoLC)1021234.2fast 7aMilitary leadership0(OCoLC)1185276.2fast 7aEuropezGaul0(OCoLC)1240016.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast02aClement,cof Alexandria, Saint,dapproximately 150-approximately 215,eauthor.tThe rich man's salvation.02aClement,cof Alexandria, Saint,dapproximately 150-approximately 215,eauthor.tTo the newly baptized.1 aButterworth, G.

He shares his enthusiasm for great sites, describing them with care and an accuracy confirmed by comparison with monuments that still stand today.bPausanias, born probably in Lydia in Asia Minor, was a Greek of the 2nd century CE, about 120-180, who travelled widely not only in Asia Minor, Palestine, Egypt and North Africa, but also in Greece and in Italy, including Rome. He left a description of Greece in ten books, which is like a topographical guidebook or tour of Attica, the Peloponnese, and central Greece, filled out with historical accounts and events and digressions on facts and wonders of nature. His chief interest was the monuments of art and architecture, especially the most famous of them; the accuracy of his descriptions of these is proved by surviving remains. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Pausanias is in five volumes; the fifth volume contains maps, plans, illustrations, and a general index.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aAntiquities0(OCoLC)810745.2fast 7aArt, Greek0(OCoLC)816343.2fast 7aClassical geography0(OCoLC)863484.2fast 7aTravel0(OCoLC)1155558.2fast 0aGreecexAntiquities. 0aGreecexDescription and travel. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aJones, W.

His poems are sometimes obscene, in the tradition of the genre, sometimes affectionate or amusing, and always pointed.bWritten to celebrate the 80 CE opening of the Roman Colosseum, Martial's first book of poems, "On the Spectacles," tells of the shows in the new arena. The great Latin epigrammist's twelve subsequent books capture the spirit of Roman life in vivid detail. Fortune hunters and busybodies, orators and lawyers, schoolmasters and acrobats, doctors and plagiarists, beautiful slaves and generous hosts populate his witty verses. We glimpse here the theater, public games, life in the countryside, banquets, lions in the amphitheater, the eruption of Vesuvius. Martial's epigrams are sometimes obscene, sometimes affectionate and amusing, and always pointed. Like his contemporary Statius, though, Martial shamelessly flatters his patron Domitian, one of Rome's worst-reputed emperors. Shackleton Bailey's translation of Martial's often difficult Latin eliminates many misunderstandings in previous versions. The text is mainly that of his highly praised Teubner edition of 1990 ("greatly superior to its predecessors," R. G. M. Nisbet wrote in Classical Review).

There is also an address of thanks to Gratian for the consulship. The stated aim of Eucharisticus by Paulinus Pellaeus (376-after 459 CE) is to give thanks for the guidance of providence in its author's life.bAusonius (Decimus Magnus), ca. 310-ca. 395 CE, a doctor's son, was born at Burdigala (Bordeaux). After a good education in grammar and rhetoric and a short period during which he was an advocate, he took to teaching rhetoric in a school which he began in 334. Among his students was Paulinus, who was afterwards Bishop of Nola; and he seems to have become some sort of Christian himself. Thirty years later Ausonius was called by Emperor Valentinian to be tutor to Gratian, who subsequently as emperor conferred on him honours including a consulship in 379. In 383, after Gratian's murder, Ausonius retired to Bordeaux. Ausonius's surviving works, some with deep feeling, some composed it seems for fun, some didactic, include much poetry: poems about himself and family, notably "The Daily Round"; epitaphs on heroes in the Trojan War, memorials on Roman emperors, and epigrams on various subjects; poems about famous cities and about friends and colleagues. "The Moselle," a description of that river, is among the most admired of his poems. There is also an address of thanks to Gratian for the consulship.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEvely-White, Hugh Gerard d. 1924. 0aLatin poetry. 7aDidactic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)893018.2fast 7aEpigrams, Latin0(OCoLC)914156.2fast 7aEpistolary poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)914353.2fast 7aLatin poetry0(OCoLC)993373.2fast 7aTravel0(OCoLC)1155558.2fast 7aEuropezMoselle River0(OCoLC)1240420.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aEvelyn-White, Hugh G.q(Hugh Gerard),d1884-1924,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAusonius, Decimus Magnus.sWorks.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1919z9780674991071(v.1)z9780674991279(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v96, 115.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL096/1919/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL115/1921/volume.xml03395nam a22004934a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002500228072002300253072002300276072002300299100002000322245009000342250004400432260005400476300002200530490003900552504003700591505004400628520138500672538003602057546006002093588004702153650005102200650004002251650005102291650004502342650003902387650005402426700005202480700006202532776013702594830004002731856006502771856006502836hup0000204MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1919    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674995611q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995802q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198828  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA4025.A5bH664 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aLIT0140002bisacsh0 aHomer,eauthor.10aOdysseyh[electronic resource] /cHomer ; with an English translation by A.T.

The latter tells of Odysseus's journey home from the Trojan War and the temptations, delays, and dangers he faced at every turn.bHere is a new Loeb Classical Library edition of the resplendent epic tale of Odysseus's long journey home from the Trojan War and the legendary temptations, delays, and perils he faced at every turn. Homer's classic poem features Odysseus's encounters with the beautiful nymph Calypso; the queenly but wily Circe; the Lotus-eaters, who fed his men their memory-stealing drug; the man-eating, one-eyed Cyclops; the Laestrygonian giants; the souls of the dead in Hades; the beguiling Sirens; the treacherous Scylla and Charybdis. Here, too, is the hero's faithful wife, Penelope, weaving a shroud by day and unraveling it by night, in order to thwart the numerous suitors attempting to take Odysseus's place. The works attributed to Homer include the two oldest and greatest European epic poems, the Odyssey and Iliad. These texts have long stood in the Loeb Classical Library with a faithful and literate prose translation by A. T. Murray. George Dimock now brings the Loeb's Odyssey up to date, with a rendering that retains Murray's admirable style but is worded for today's readers. The two-volume edition includes a new introduction, notes, and index.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEpic poetry, GreekxTranslations into English. 0aOdysseus (Greek mythology)vPoetry. 7aCities and townsxGrowth0(OCoLC)861781.2fast 7aEpic poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)913902.2fast 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 7aOdysseus (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1043923.2fast1 aDimock, George E.cJr.d1917-2000,etranslator.1 aMurray, A.

Aeschines' powerful speeches include Against Timarchus, On the False Embassy, and Against Ctesiphon.bAeschines, orator and statesman of Athens, 390 or 389-314 BCE, became active in politics about 350. In 348 he was a member of a mission sent to the Peloponnese to stir up feeling against the growing power of king Philip of Macedon; but in 347, when part of a peace-making embassy to Philip, was won over to sympathy with the king, and became a supporter of the peace policy of the Athenian statesman Eubulus. On a second embassy in 346 to ratify a peace Aeschines' delaying tactics caused the famous orator Demosthenes and Timarchus to accuse him of treason, a charge which he successfully rebutted in the strong extant speech Against Timarchus. In 344-343, when Demosthenes accused him again in a speech, Aeschines replied in the fine extant speech having the same title On the False Embassy and was again acquitted. In 336, when Ctesiphon proposed that Demosthenes should be awarded a crown of gold for state service, Aeschines accused him of proposing something which would violate existing laws. At the trial Aeschines' extant speech Against Ctesiphon was answered by Demosthenes in his masterpiece On the Crown. Aeschines, discredited, left Athens and set up a school of rhetoric at Rhodes. He died in Samos. As examples of Greek oratory the speeches of Aeschines rank next to those of Demosthenes, and are important documents for the study of Athenian diplomacy and inner politics.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Greek. 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Greek0(OCoLC)1129363.2fast 0aAthens (Greece)xPolitics and governmentvEarly works to 1800.1 aAdams, C.

Although unfinished and as a whole unrevised, in brilliance of description and depth of insight this history has no superior.bThucydides of Athens, one of the greatest of historians, was born about 471 BCE. He saw the rise of Athens to greatness under the inspired leadership of Pericles. In 430, the second year of the Peloponnesian War, he caught and survived the horrible plague which he described so graphically. Later, as general in 423 he failed to save Amphipolis from the enemy and was disgraced. He tells about this, not in volumes of self-justification, but in one sentence of his history of the war--that it befell him to be an exile for twenty years. He then lived probably on his property in Thrace, but was able to observe both sides in certain campaigns of the war, and returned to Athens after her defeat in 404. He had been composing his famous history, with its hopes and horrors, triumphs and disasters, in full detail from first-hand knowledge of his own and others. The war was really three conflicts with one uncertain peace after the first; and Thucydides had not unified them into one account when death came sometime before 396. His history of the first conflict, 431-421, was nearly complete; Thucydides was still at work on this when the war spread to Sicily and into a conflict (415-413) likewise complete in his awful and brilliant record, though not fitted into the whole. His story of the final conflict of 413-404 breaks off (in the middle of a sentence) when dealing with the year 411. So his work was left unfinished and as a whole unrevised. Yet in brilliance of description and depth of insight this history has no superior. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Thucydides is in four volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aInscriptions, Greek0(OCoLC)973878.2fast 0aGreecexHistoryyPeloponnesian War, 431 B.C.-404 B.C. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aSmith, Charles Forster,d1852-1931,etranslator.08iPrint version:aThucydides.tHistory of the Peloponnesian war.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1919z9780674991200(v.1)z9780674991217(v.2)z9780674991224(v.3)z9780674991873(v.4) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v108-110, 169.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL108/1919/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL109/1920/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL110/1921/volume.xml403v.4uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL169/1923/volume.xml02703nam a22004214a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251100003900274245009800313260005400411300002200465490003900487504004100526520102700567538003601594546006001630588004701690650002001737650004101757650004001798650003501838651004101873700004301914776015401957830004002111856006502151856006502216hup0000212MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1919    mau    gob    00| i eng d  z9780674991248q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674991255q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198829  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.F766 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aFronto, Marcus Cornelius,eauthor.10aCorrespondenceh[electronic resource] /cFronto ; with an English translation by C.R.

His letters reveal Fronto's strong stylistic views and dislike of Stoicism as well as his family joys and sorrows. They portray the successes and trials of a prominent figure in the palace, literary salons, the Senate, and lawcourts, and they give a fascinating record of the relationship between the foremost teacher of his time and his illustrious student Marcus Aurelius, his chief correspondent. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Fronto is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aLettersxLatin. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aLatin letters0(OCoLC)993327.2fast 7aOrators0(OCoLC)1047212.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aHaines, Charles Reginald,etranslator.08iPrint version:aFronto, Marcus Cornelius.tCorrespondence.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1919z9780674991248(v.1)z9780674991255(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v112-113.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL112/1919/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL113/1920/volume.xml06036nam a22007574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341020004100382020004100423020004200464020004200506020004200548020004200590020004200632035002100674040001200695041001800707050002300725072002300748072002300771100001900794245008600813260005400899300005000953490010001003504004101103505105401144520119302198538003603391546006003427588004703487651004403534651004603578651004103624700003203665700004503697700003103742700004603773700006303819776038003882830010104262856006504363856006504428856006504493856006504558856006504623856006504688856006504753856006504818856006504883856006604948856006605014856006605080856006605146856006605212hup0000214MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1919    maub   gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674991262q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674991484q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674991903q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674992108q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674992566q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674993921q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674994041q(v. 7)qprint version  z9780674994195q(v. 8)qprint version  z9780674993266q(v. 9)qprint version  z9780674993327q(v. 10)qprint version  z9780674993464q(v. 11)qprint version  z9780674993662q(v. 12)qprint version  z9780674994355q(v. 13)qprint version  z9780674994454q(v. 14)qprint version  a(OCoLC)848583639  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.L589 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aLivy,eauthor.10aHistory of Romeh[electronic resource] /cLivy ; general index by Russel M.

Of its 142 books 1-10, 21-45 (except parts of 41 and 43-45), fragments, and short summaries remain. Livy's history is a source for the De Prodigiis of Julius Obsequens (fourth century CE).bLivy (Titus Livius), the great Roman historian, was born at or near Patavium (Padua) in 64 or 59 BCE; he may have lived mostly in Rome but died at Patavium, in 12 or 17 CE. Livy's only extant work is part of his history of Rome from the foundation of the city to 9 BCE. Of its 142 books, we have just 35, and short summaries of all the rest except two. The whole work was, long after his death, divided into Decades or series of ten. Books 1-10 we have entire; books 11-20 are lost; books 21-45 are entire, except parts of 41 and 43-45. Of the rest only fragments and the summaries remain. In splendid style Livy--a man of wide sympathies and proud of Rome's past--presented an uncritical but clear and living narrative of the rise of Rome to greatness. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Livy is in fourteen volumes. The last volume includes a comprehensive index.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aRomexHistoryyKings, 753 B.C.-510 B.C. 0aRomexHistoryyRepublic, 510 B.C.-30 B.C. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aObsequens, Julius,eauthor.1 aaSage, Evan Taylor,d1881-etranslator.1 aFoster, B.

Although Sallust is decidedly unsubtle and partisan in analyzing people and events, his works are important and significantly influenced later historians, notably Tacitus.bSallust, Gaius Sallustius Crispus (86-35 BCE), a Sabine from Amiternum, acted against Cicero and Milo as tribune in 52, joined Caesar after being expelled from the Senate in 50, was restored to the Senate by Caesar and took part in his African campaign as praetor in 46, and was then appointed governor of New Africa (Numidia). Upon his return to Rome he narrowly escaped conviction for malfeasance in office, retired from public life, and took up historiography. Sallust's two extant monographs take as their theme the moral and political decline of Rome, one on the conspiracy of Catiline and the other on the war with Jugurtha. Although Sallust is decidedly unsubtle and partisan in analyzing people and events, his works are important and significantly influenced later historians, notably Tacitus. Taking Thucydides as his model but building on Roman stylistic and rhetorical traditions, Sallust achieved a distinctive style, concentrated and arresting; lively characterizations, especially in the speeches; and skill at using particular episodes to illustrate large general themes. For this edition, Rolfe's text and translation of the Catiline and Jugurtha have been thoroughly revised in line with the most recent scholarship.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aHistorianszRome. 0aLatin literaturevTranslations into English. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast02aSallust,d86 B.C.-34 B.C.eauthor.tThe war with Jugurtha.1 aRamsey, J.

He travelled widely in most of Asia Minor, Egypt (as far as Assuan), North Africa, Syria, the country north of the Black Sea, and many parts of the Aegean Sea and the mainland of Greece. He lived, it seems, for some time in Athens, and in 443 went with other colonists to the new city Thurii (in South Italy), where he died about 430. He was "the prose correlative of the bard, a narrator of the deeds of real men, and a describer of foreign places" (Murray). Herodotus's famous history of warfare between the Greeks and the Persians has an epic dignity which enhances his delightful style. It includes the rise of the Persian power and an account of the Persian empire; a description and history of Egypt; and a long digression on the geography and customs of Scythia. Even in the later books on the attacks of the Persians against Greece there are digressions. All is most entertaining and produces a grand unity. After personal inquiry and study of hearsay and other evidence, Herodotus gives us a not uncritical estimate of the best that he could find. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Herodotus is in four volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aHistory, Ancient. 7aHistory, Ancient0(OCoLC)958352.2fast 0aGreecexHistoryyTo 146 B.C. 0aGreecexHistory. 7aEgypt0(OCoLC)1208755.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aIran0(OCoLC)1204889.2fast1 aGodley, A.

Written in clear and unaffected style, the compendium faithfully follows the Greek literary sources. It is thus an important record of Greek accounts of the origin and early history of the world and their race. This work has been attributed to Apollodorus of Athens (born c. 180 BCE), a student of Aristarchus. But the text as we have it was written by an author probably living in the first or second century of our era. In his highly valued notes to the Loeb Classical Library edition (which is in two volumes) J. G. Frazer cites the principal passages of other ancient writers where each particular story is told and compares the various versions to those in the Library.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aFrazer, James George,cSir,d1854-1941,eed. and tr. 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast1 aFrazer, James George,cSir,d1854-1941,etranslator.08iPrint version:aApollodorus.tThe library.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1921z9780674991354(v.1)z9780674991361(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v121-122.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL121/1921/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL122/1921/volume.xml04322nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100002000248245011300268260005400381300002200435490003500457500002000492520248800512538003603000546006003036588004703096600001403143650003803157650003503195650005403230650004303284650004003327650004703367650005403414650004503468650003503513700003003548700005103578776011503629830003603744856006003780hup0000223MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1921    mau    go     00| m eng d  z9780674991378qprint version  a(OCoLC)756446441  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.P538 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aPlato,eauthor.10aTheaetetush[electronic resource] ; bSophist /cPlato ; with an English translation by Harold North Fowler.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v123  aIncludes index.  aThe great Athenian philosopher Plato was born in 427 BCE and lived to be eighty. Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aSocrates. 0aMethodologyvEarly works to 1800. 0aOntologyvEarly works to 1800. 0aSophists (Greek philosophy)vEarly works to 1800. 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aPhilosophers0(OCoLC)1060746.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aPolitical and social views0(OCoLC)1353986.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aUtopias0(OCoLC)1163359.2fast02aPlato,eauthor.tSophist.1 aFowler, Harold North,d1859-1955,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPlato.tTheaetetus.

The Orator's Education (Institutio Oratoria), a comprehensive training program in twelve books, draws on his own rich experience. It is a work of enduring importance, not only for its insights on oratory, but for the picture it paints of education and social attitudes in the Roman world. Quintilian offers both general and specific advice. He gives guidelines for proper schooling (beginning with the young boy); analyzes the structure of speeches; recommends devices that will engage listeners and appeal to their emotions; reviews a wide range of Greek and Latin authors of use to the orator; and counsels on memory, delivery, and gestures. Donald Russell's new five-volume Loeb Classical Library edition of The Orator's Education, which replaces an eighty-year-old translation by H. E. Butler, provides a text and facing translation fully up to date in light of current scholarship and well tuned to today's taste. Russell also provides unusually rich explanatory notes, which enable full appreciation of this central work in the history of rhetoric.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEducationzRome. 0aOratoryvEarly works to 1800. 7aOratory0(OCoLC)1047214.2fast1 aRussell, D.

The main part of the work, a vital achievement despite the incomplete state in which all but the first five books of an original forty survive, describes the rise of Rome, its destruction of Carthage, and its eventual domination of the Greek world.bThe historian Polybius (ca. 200-118 BCE) was born into a leading family of Megalopolis in the Peloponnese (Morea) and served the Achaean League in arms and diplomacy for many years, favoring alliance with Rome. From 168 to 151 he was held hostage in Rome, where he became a friend of Lucius Aemilius Paulus and his two sons, especially Scipio Aemilianus, whose campaigns, including the destruction of Carthage, he later attended. Late in his life he became a trusted mediator between Greece and the Romans; helped in the discussions that preceded the final war with Carthage; and after 146 was entrusted by the Romans with the details of administration in Greece. Polybius' overall theme is how and why the Romans spread their power as they did. The main part of his history covers the years 264-146 BCE, describing the rise of Rome, her destruction of Carthage, and her eventual domination of the Greek world. It is a great work: accurate, thoughtful, largely impartial, based on research, and full of insight into customs, institutions, geography, the causes of events, and the character of peoples. It is a vital achievement of the first importance despite the incomplete state in which all but the first five of its original forty books have reached us. For this edition, W. R. Paton's excellent translation, first published in 1922, has been thoroughly revised, the Büttner-Wobst Greek text corrected, and explanatory notes and a new introduction added, all reflecting the latest scholarship.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aHistory, Ancient. 7aHistory, Ancient0(OCoLC)958352.2fast 0aGreecexHistoryy146 B.C.-323 A.D. 0aGreecexHistoryy146 B.C.-323 A.D.vEarly works to 1800. 0aGreecexHistoryyTo 146 B.C. 0aGreecexHistoryyTo 146 B.C.vEarly works to 1800. 0aRomexHistoryyRepublic, 510 B.C.-30 B.C.vEarly works to 1800. 0aRomexHistoryyRepublic, 510-30 B.C. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aHabicht, Christian,eeditor,etranslator.1 aOlson, S.

The monodrama Alexandra is attributed to his contemporary, Lycophron. Phaenomena, a poem on star constellations and weather signs by Aratus (c. 315-245 BCE), was among the most widely read in antiquity and one of the few Greek poems translated into Arabic.bCallimachus of Cyrene, 3rd century BCE, became after 284 a teacher of grammar and poetry at Alexandria. He was made a librarian in the new library there and prepared a catalogue of its books. He died about the year 240. Of his large published output, only 6 hymns, 63 epigrams, and fragments survive (the fragments are in Loeb no. 421). The hymns are very learned and artificial in style; the epigrams are good (they are also in the Loeb Greek Anthology volumes). Lycophron of Chalcis in Euboea was a contemporary of Callimachus in Alexandria where he became supervisor of the comedies included in the new library. He wrote a treatise on these and composed tragedies and other poetry. We possess Alexandra or Cassandra wherein Cassandra foretells the fortune of Troy and the besieging Greeks. This poem is a curiosity--a showpiece of knowledge of obscure stories, names, and words. Aratus of Soli in Cilicia, ca. 315-245 BCE, was a didactic poet at the court of Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia, where he wrote his famous astronomical poem Phaenomena (Appearances). He was for a time in the court of Antiochus I of Syria but returned to Macedonia.

A student, the historian Arrian, recorded Epictetus's lectures and, in the Encheiridion, a handbook, summarized his thought.bEpictetus was a crippled Greek slave of Phrygia during Nero's reign (54-68 CE) who heard lectures by the Stoic Musonius before he was freed. Expelled with other philosophers by the emperor Domitian in 89 or 92 he settled permanently in Nicopolis in Epirus. There, in a school which he called "healing place for sick souls," he taught a practical philosophy, details of which were recorded by Arrian, a student of his, and survive in four books of Discourses and a smaller Encheiridion, a handbook which gives briefly the chief doctrines of the Discourses. He apparently lived into the reign of Hadrian (117-138 CE) .Epictetus was a teacher of Stoic ethics, broad and firm in method, sublime in thought, and now humorous, now sad or severe in spirit. How should one live righteously? Our god-given will is our paramount possession, and we must not covet others'. We must not resist fortune. Man is part of a system; humans are reasoning beings (in feeble bodies) and must conform to god's mind and the will of nature. Epictetus presents us also with a pungent picture of the perfect (Stoic) man.

The complete play, Dyskolos (The Peevish Fellow), won first prize in Athens in 317 BCE.bMenander, the dominant figure in New Comedy, wrote over 100 plays. By the Middle Ages they had all been lost. Happily papyrus finds in Egypt during the past century have recovered one complete play, substantial portions of six others, and smaller but still interesting fragments. Menander was highly regarded in antiquity and his plots, set in Greece, were adapted for the Roman world by Plautus and Terence. Geoffrey Arnott's new Loeb edition is in three volumes. Volume I contains six plays, including the only complete one extant, Dyskolos (The Peevish Fellow), which won first prize in Athens in 317 BCE, and Dis Expaton (Twice a Swindler), the original of Plautus' Two Bacchises. Volume II contains the surviving portions of ten Menander plays. Among these are the recently published fragments of Misoumenos (The Man She Hated), which sympathetically presents the flawed relationship of a soldier and a captive girl; and the surviving half of Perikeiromene (The Girl with Her Hair Cut Short), a comedy of mistaken identity and lovers' quarrel. Volume III begins with Samia (The Woman from Samos), which has come down to us nearly complete. Here too are the very substantial extant portions of Sikyonioi (The Sicyonians) and Phasma (The Apparition) as well as Synaristosai (Women Lunching Together), on which Plautus's Cistellaria was based. Arnott's edition of the great Hellenistic playwright has been garnering wide praise for making these fragmentary texts more accesible, elucidating their dramatic movement.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aMenander,cof AthensxTranslations into English. 7aClassical drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)863473.2fast 7aGreek drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)947136.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aArnott, W.

Lives of Philosophers and Sophists by Eunapius (born 347 CE) is our only source concerning Neo-Platonism in the latter part of the fourth century CE.bOf the distinguished Lemnian family of Philostrati, Flavius Philostratus "the Athenian," ca. 170-205 CE, was a Greek sophist who studied at Athens and later lived in Rome. He was author of the admirable Life of Apollonius of Tyana (Loeb nos. 16 and 17) and of Lives of the Sophists, a treasury of information about notable sophists. Philostratus's sketches of sophists in action yield a fascinating picture of the predominant influence of Sophistic in the educational, social, and political life of the Empire in the second and third centuries. The Greek sophist and historian Eunapius was born at Sardis in 347 CE, but went to Athens to study and lived much of his life there teaching rhetoric and possibly medicine. He was initiated into the mysteries and was hostile to Christians. His Lives of Philosophers and Sophists (mainly contemporary with himself) is our only source for knowledge of Neo-Platonism in the latter part of the fourth century.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPhilosophers. 0aSophists (Greek philosophy) 7aEunapius0(OCoLC)1765214.2fast 7aPainting0(OCoLC)1050567.2fast 7aPainting, Greco-Roman0(OCoLC)1050861.2fast 7aPhilosophers0(OCoLC)1060746.2fast 7aSophists (Greek philosophy)0(OCoLC)1126720.2fast0 aEunapius,dapproximately 345-approximately 420,eauthor.tLives of the philosophers and sophists.1 aWright, Wilmer Cave,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPhilostratus, the Athenian, active 2nd century-3rd century.tLives of the sophists.

A panegyric on the brothers Probinus and Olybrius (consuls together in 395 CE) was followed mostly by epics in hexameters, but also by elegiacs, epistles, epigrams, and idylls.bClaudius Claudianus, Latin poet of great affairs, flourished during the joint reigns (394-5 CE onwards) of the brothers Honorius (Emperor in the West) and Arcadius (in the East). Apparently a native of Greek Alexandria in Egypt, he was, to judge by his name, of Roman descent, though his first writings were in Greek, and his pure Latin may have been learned by him as a foreign language. About 395 CE he moved to Italy (Milan and Rome) and though really a pagan, became a professional court-poet composing for Christian rulers works which give us important knowledge of Honorius's time. A panegyric on the brothers Probinus and Olybrius (consuls together in 395) was followed during ten years by other poems (mostly epics in hexameters): in praise of consulships of Honorius (395, 398, 404 CE); against the Byzantine ministers Rufinus (396) and Eutropius (399); in praise of the consulship (400) of Stilicho (Honorius's guardian, general, and minister); in praise of Stilicho's wife Serena; mixed metres on the marriage of Honorius to their daughter Maria; on the war with the rebel Gildo in Africa (398); on the Getic or Gothic war (402); on Stilicho's success against the Goth Alaric (403); on the consulship of Manlius Theodorus (399); and on the wedding of Palladius and Celerina. Less important are non-official poems such as the three books of a mythological epic on the Rape of Proserpina, unfinished as was also a Battle of Giants (in Greek). Noteworthy are Phoenix, Senex Veronensis, elegiac prefaces, and the epistles, epigrams, and idylls. Through the patronage of Stilicho or through Serena, Claudius in 404 married well in Africa and was granted a statue in Rome. Nothing is known of him after 404.

Of uncertain reliability and authorship, it is now attributed by many authorities to one late fourth century CE author.bThe Scriptores Historiae Augustae, or Historia Augusta, is a collection of biographies of Roman emperors, heirs, and claimants from Hadrian to Numerianus (117- 284 CE). The work, which is modeled on Suetonius, purports to be written by six different authors and quotes documents and public records extensively. Since we possess no continuous account of the emperors of the second and third centuries, the Historia Augusta has naturally attracted keen attention. In the last century it has also generated the gravest suspicions. Present opinion holds that the whole is the work of a single author (who lived in the time of Theodosius) and contains much that is plagiarism and even downright forgery. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the Historia Augusta is in three volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEmperorszRome. 0aHistorianszRome. 0aRoman law. 7aEmperors0(OCoLC)908898.2fast 7aHistorians0(OCoLC)957686.2fast 7aHistoriography0(OCoLC)958221.2fast 7aLatin prose literature0(OCoLC)993390.2fast 7aRoman law0(OCoLC)1099759.2fast 0aRomexHistoriography. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aMagie, David,d1877-etranslator.08iPrint version:tHistoria Augusta.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1921z9780674991545(v.1)z9780674991552(v.2)z9780674992900(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v139-140, 263.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL139/1921/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL140/1924/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL263/1932/volume.xml02911nam a22004094a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002500179072002300204072002300227072002300250100003700273245010300310250000900413260005400422300002200476490003500498500002000533520140600553538003601959546006001995588004702055650002502102650003502127650004602162700005702208776014002265830003602405856006002441hup0000241MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1927    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674991569qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735639  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156.C6bC534 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh1 aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.10aTusculan disputationsh[electronic resource] /cCicero ; with an English translation by J.E.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPhilosophy, Ancient. 7aHappiness0(OCoLC)9511602fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)10608602fast1 aKing, J.

The new school of poetry and anonymous songs and hymns.  aThe five volumes in the Loeb Classical Library edition of Greek Lyric contain the surviving fragments of solo and choral song. This poetry was not preserved in medieval manuscripts, and few complete poems remain. Later writers quoted from the poets, but only so much as suited their needs; these quotations are supplemented by papyrus texts found in Egypt, most of them badly damaged. The high quality of what remains makes us realize the enormity of our loss.bSappho, the most famous woman poet of antiquity, whose main theme was love, and Alcaeus, poet of wine, war, and politics, were two illustrious singers of sixth-century BCE Lesbos. Anacreon (c. 570-485 BCE) was a composer of solo song. The Anacreonta were composed over several centuries. Notable among the earliest writers of choral poetry are the seventh-century BCE Spartans Alcman and Terpander. The most important poets writing in Greek in the sixth century BCE came from Sicily and southern Italy. They included Stesichorus, Ibycus, and Simonides, as well as Arion, Lasus, and Pratinas. Bacchylides wrote masterful choral poetry of many types. Other fifth-century BCE lyricists included Myrtis, Telesilla of Argos, Timocreon of Rhodes, Charixena, Diagoras of Melos, Ion of Chios, Praxilla of Sicyon. More of Boeotian Corinna's (third-century BCE?) poetry survives than that of any other Greek woman poet except Sappho. Dithyrambic poets of the new school were active from the mid-fifth to mid-fourth century BCE. Anonymous poems include drinking songs, children's ditties, and cult hymns.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek poetryxTranslations into English. 0aGreek poetry. 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast0 aAlcaeus,eauthor.0 aAnacreon,eauthor.0 aBacchylides,eauthor.0 aCorinna,cof Tanagra,dactive 5th century B.C.eauthor.0 aIbycus,dactive 6th century B.C.eauthor.0 aSappho,eauthor.0 aSimonides,dapproximately 556 B.C.-467 B.C.eauthor.0 aStesichorus,eauthor.1 aCampbell, David A.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:tGreek lyric.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1982z9780674991576(v.1)z9780674991583(v.2)z9780674995253(v.3)z9780674995086(v.4)z9780674995598(v.5) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v142-144, 461, 476.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL142/1982/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL143/1988/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL476/1991/volume.xml403v.4uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL461/1992/volume.xml403v.5uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL144/1993/volume.xml03722nam a22005174a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177035002100218040001200239041001800251050002300269072002300292072002300315100002400338243002800362245008600390260005400476300002200530490004400552504003700596505015200633520147300785538003602258546006002294588004702354600004202401650002902443650005702472650005202529650004402581650006602625651003402691651004202725700004702767776015002814830004502964856006503009856006503074856006503139hup0000245MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2009    mau    gob    00| d eng d  z9780674996274q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674996281q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674996298q(v. 3)qprint version  a(OCoLC)681050202  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3827b.A373 2014 7aDRA0060002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aAeschylus,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Greek10aAeschylush[electronic resource] /cedited and translated by Alan H.

He won the tragic prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times between ca. 499 and 458, and in his later years was probably victorious almost every time he put on a production, though Sophocles beat him at least once.bOf his total of about eighty plays, seven survive complete. The first volume of this new Loeb Classical Library edition offers fresh texts and translations by Alan H. Sommerstein of Persians, the only surviving Greek historical drama; Seven against Thebes, from a trilogy on the conflict between Oedipus' sons; Suppliants, on the successful appeal by the daughters of Danaus to the king and people of Argos for protection against a forced marriage; and Prometheus Bound (of disputed authenticity), on the terrible punishment of Prometheus for giving fire to humans in defiance of Zeus. The second volume contains the complete Oresteia trilogy, comprising Agamemnon, Libation-Bearers, and Eumenides, presenting the murder of Agamemnon by his wife, the revenge taken by their son Orestes, the pursuit of Orestes by his mother's avenging Furies, his trial and acquittal at Athens, Athena's pacification of the Furies, and the blessings they both invoke upon the Athenian people. The third volume collects all the major fragments of lost Aeschylean plays.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAeschylusvTranslations into English. 0aMythology, GreekvDrama. 7aClytemnestra (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)865002.2fast 7aErinyes (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)914691.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aSeven against Thebes (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1113646.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aGreecezThebes0(OCoLC)1229872.2fast1 aSommerstein, Alan H.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAeschylus.sWorks.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2009z9780674996274(v.1)z9780674996281(v.2)z9780674996298(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v145-146, 505.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL145/2009/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL146/2009/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL505/2009/volume.xml05164nam a22007094a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341020004100382020004100423020004200464035002100506040001200527041001800539050002300557072002300580072002300603072002300626100002600649243002800675245004000703260005400743300005000797490006800847504004100915505128600956520063602242538003602878546006002914588004702974650003103021650001403052650003603066650005303102651003403155700003803189700007003227700003803297700005103335700005503386776029303441830006903734856006503803856006503868856006503933856006503998856006504063856006504128856006504193856006504258856006504323856006604388hup0000247MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1923    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674991620q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674991644q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674991651q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674991668q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674995208q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674995222q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674995260q(v. 7)qprint version  z9780674995314q(v. 8)qprint version  z9780674996403q(v. 9)qprint version  z9780674996830q(v. 10)qprint version  a(OCoLC)615590833  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.H577 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aMED0390002bisacsh0 aHippocrates,eauthor.10aWorks.lEnglish & Greek10aHippocratesh[electronic resource].  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource :bline illustrations, maps1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v147-150, 472-473, 477, 482, 509, 520  aIncludes bibliographies and indexes.0 av.

Apparently he rejected superstition in favour of inductive reasoning and the study of real medicine as subject to natural laws, in general and in individual people as patients for treatment by medicines and surgery. Of the roughly 70 works in the Hippocratic Collection," many are not by Hippocrates; even the famous oath may not be his. But he was undeniably the "Father of Medicine."  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMedicine, Greek and Roman. 0aMedicine. 7aMedicine0(OCoLC)1014893.2fast 7aMedicine, Greek and Roman0(OCoLC)1015251.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast0 aHeraclitus,cof Ephesus,eauthor.1 aJones, W.

Later he did considerable public service there, and otherwise devoted himself to poetry and to society. Famous at first, he offended the emperor Augustus by his Ars Amatoria, and was banished because of this work and some other reason unknown to us, and dwelt in the cold and primitive town of Tomis on the Black Sea. He continued writing poetry, a kindly man, leading a temperate life. He died in exile. Ovid's main surviving works are the Metamorphoses, a source of inspiration to artists and poets including Chaucer and Shakespeare; the Fasti, a poetic treatment of the Roman year of which Ovid finished only half; the Amores, love poems; the Ars Amatoria, not moral but clever and in parts beautiful; Heroides, fictitious love letters by legendary women to absent husbands; and the dismal works written in exile: the Tristia, appeals to persons including his wife and also the emperor; and similar Epistulae ex Ponto. Poetry came naturally to Ovid, who at his best is lively, graphic and lucid.

He was quaestor in 7 CE, praetor in 15. He wrote in two books Roman Histories, a summary of Roman history from the fall of Troy to 29 CE. As he approached his own times he becomes much fuller in his treatment, especially between the death of Caesar in 44 BCE and that of Augustus in 14 CE. His work has useful concise essays on Roman colonies and provinces and some effective compressed portrayals of characters. Res Gestae Divi Augusti. In his 76th year (13 CE-14) the emperor Augustus wrote a dignified account of his public life and work of which the best preserved copy (with a Greek translation) was engraved by the Galatians on the walls of the temple of Augustus at Ancyra (Ankara).

His history of the Christian church from the ministry of Jesus to 324 CE is a treasury of information, especially on the Eastern centers.bEusebius of Caesarea, ca. 260-340 CE, born in Palestine, was a student of the presbyter Pamphilus whom he loyally supported during Diocletian's persecution. He was himself imprisoned in Egypt, but became Bishop of Caesarea about 314. At the Council of Nicaea in 325 he sat by the emperor, led a party of moderates, and made the first draft of the famous creed. Of Eusebius's many learned publications we have Martyrs of Palestine and Life of Constantine; several apologetic and polemic works; parts of his commentaries on the Psalms and Isaiah; and the Chronographia, known chiefly in Armenian and Syriac versions of the original Greek. But Eusebius's chief fame rests on the History of the Christian Church in ten books published in 324-325, the most important ecclesiastical history of ancient times, a great treasury of knowledge about the early Church.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aChurch historyyPrimitive and early church, approximately 30-600. 0aChurch historyyPrimitive and early church, ca. 30-600. 7aChurch history0(OCoLC)860740.2fast 7aChurch historyxPrimitive and early church0(OCoLC)1710945.2fast1 aLake, Kirsopp,d1872-1946,etranslator.1 aOulton, John Ernest Leonard,d1886-etranslator.08iPrint version:aEusebius, of Caesarea, Bishop of Caesarea, approximately 260-approximately 340.tEcclesiastical history.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1926z9780674991699(v.1)z9780674992931(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v153, 265.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL153/1926/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL265/1932/volume.xml03324nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002500179072002300204072002300227072002300250100003700273245014400310246004500454260005400499300002200553490003500575500002200610520140600632538003602038546006002074588004702134650003702181650003702218650003402255650003702289650003702326650003502363650004402398700005102442700005402493700004602547776015302593830003602746856006002782hup0000254MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1923    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674991705qprint version  a(OCoLC)646871515  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156.C5bC534 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh1 aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.10aDe senectuteh[electronic resource] ; bDe amicitia ; De divinatione /cCicero ; with an English translation by William Armistead Falconer.14aOn old age.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aDivinationvEarly works to 1800. 0aFriendshipvEarly works to 1800. 0aOld agevEarly works to 1800. 7aDivination0(OCoLC)895747.2fast 7aFriendship0(OCoLC)935174.2fast 7aOld age0(OCoLC)1045272.2fast 7aOratory, Ancient0(OCoLC)1047223.2fast12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tDe amicitia.12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tDe divinatione.1 aFalconer, William Armistead,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tOn old age.

Asclepiodotus (first century BCE) wrote a work on Tactics as though for the lecture room, based on earlier manuals, not personal experience. Onasander's The General (first century CE) deals with the qualities expected of a general.bAeneas was perhaps a general, and certainly author of several didactic military works of which the sole survivor is that on defence against siege. From it we can deduce that he was a Peloponnesian of the fourth century BCE who served in the Aegean and in Asia Minor and composed the work from direct knowledge and from oral and some literary tradition, possibly in 357-6 BCE. It is devoted entirely to defence of fortified places and deals specially with use of defending troops; defensive positions; morale; resistance to attacks and to actual assault; guards; obviation of treachery and revolution; and other subjects. Asclepiodotus, philosopher and pupil of the Stoic Posidonius, wrote a rather dry but ordered work on Tactics as if a subject of the lecture room, based not on personal experience but on earlier manuals. His main subjects were the branches of a military force; infantry; cavalry; chariots; elephants; arms; maneuvers; military evolutions; marching formation. The work ends with words of command. Onasander (Onasandros), a Platonic philosopher, dedicated his work The General to the Roman Veranius, who was a consul in 49 CE. The work deals in plain style with the sort of morals and social and military qualities and attitudes expected of a virtuous and militarily successful general. It is also concerned with such matters as his choice of staff; attitude to war; religious duties; military formations; conduct in allied and hostile lands; difficult terrains; camps; drill; spies; guards; deserters; battle formations and maneuvers; and other matters, ending with conduct after victory.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMilitary art and sciencexEarly works to 1800. 7aMilitary art and science0(OCoLC)1020874.2fast0 aAsclepiodotus,eauthor.0 aOnasander,eauthor.3 aIllinois Greek Club,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAeneas, Tacticus, active 4th century B.C.tAeneas Tacticus, Asclepiodotus, and Onasander.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1923z9780674991729 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v156.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL156/1928/volume.xml04361nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100002000248245013500268260005400403300002200457490003500479500002000514520248800534538003603022546006003058588004703118650001403165650004403179650004303223650004003266650004703306650005403353650004503407650003503452700003103487700002603518700005103544700006803595776012003663830003603783856006003819hup0000264MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1925    mau    go     00| m eng d  z9780674991828qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735666  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.P538 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aPlato,eauthor.10aStatesmanh[electronic resource] ; bPhilebus ; Ion /cPlato ; with an English translation by Harold North Fowler and W.R.M.

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.

Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEthicsvEarly works to 1800. 0aFriendship. 0aPolitical sciencevEarly works to 1800. 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aPhilosophers0(OCoLC)1060746.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aPolitical and social views0(OCoLC)1353986.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aUtopias0(OCoLC)1163359.2fast02aPlato,eauthor.tSymposium.02aPlato,eauthor.tGorgias.1 aLamb, W.

Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery).

Xenophon's Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial.bXenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE), a member of a wealthy but politically quietist Athenian family and an admirer of Socrates, left Athens in 401 BCE to serve as a mercenary commander for Cyrus the Younger of Persia, then joined the staff of King Agesilaus II of Sparta before settling in Elis and, in the aftermath of the battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE, retiring to Corinth. His historical and biographical works, Socratic dialogues and reminiscences, and short treatises on hunting, horsemanship, economics, and the Spartan constitution are richly informative about his own life and times. This volume collects Xenophon's portrayals of his associate, Socrates. In Memorabilia (or Memoirs of Socrates) and in Oeconomicus, a dialogue about household management, we see the philosopher through Xenophon's eyes. Here, as in the accompanying Symposium, we also obtain insight on life in Athens. The volume concludes with Xenophon's Apology, an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aSocratesvEarly works to 1800. 0aAgriculturevEarly works to 1800. 7aCivilization0(OCoLC)862898.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aIran0(OCoLC)1204889.2fast02aXenophon,eauthor.tOeconomicus.02aXenophon,eauthor.tSymposium.02aXenophon,eauthor.tApology.1 aHenderson, Jeffrey,d1946-eeditor,etranslator.1 aMarchant, E.

The former tells of Achilles's anger over an insult to his honour during the Trojan War, and of its consequences for the Achaeans, the Trojans, and Achilles himself.bHere is a new Loeb Classical Library edition of Homer's stirring heroic account of the Trojan war and its passions. The eloquent and dramatic epic poem captures the terrible anger of Achilles, "the best of the Achaeans," over a grave insult to his personal honor and relates its tragic result--a chain of consequences that proves devastating for the Greek forces besieging Troy, for noble Trojans, and for Achilles himself. The poet gives us compelling characterizations of his protagonists as well as a remarkable study of the heroic code in antiquity. The works attributed to Homer include the two oldest and greatest European epic poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad. These have been published in the Loeb Classical Library for three quarters of a century, the Greek text facing a faithful and literate prose translation by A. T. Murray. William F. Wyatt now brings the Loeb's Iliad up to date, with a rendering that retains Murray's admirable style but is written for today's readers.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAchilles (Greek mythology)vPoetry. 0aEpic poetry, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aTrojan WarvPoetry. 7aAchilles (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)795683.2fast 7aEpic poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)913902.2fast 7aGreeks0(OCoLC)947546.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aTurkey0(OCoLC)1208963.2fast 7aTurkeyzTroy (Extinct city)0(OCoLC)1896842.2fast1 aMurray, A.

The Aqueducts of Rome, written in 97-98, gives some historical details and a description of the aqueducts for the water supply of the city, with laws relating to them.bFrontinus, Sextus Iulius, ca. 35-103 CE, was a capable Roman civil officer and military commander. Praetor of the city in 70 and consul in 73 or 74, 98 and 100, he was, about the year 76, sent to Britain as governor. He quelled the Silures of Wales, and began to build a road through their territory; his place was taken by Agricola in 78. In 97 he was given the highly esteemed office of Manager of Aqueducts at Rome. He is known to have been an augur, being succeeded by his friend Pliny the younger. The two sides of Frontinus's public career are reflected in his two surviving works. Strategemata, Stratagems, written after 84, gives examples of military stratagems from Greek and Roman history, for the instruction of Roman officers, in three books; the fourth book is concerned largely with military discipline. De Aquis urbis Romae, The Aqueducts of Rome, written in 97-98, gives some historical details and a description of the aqueducts for the water supply of the city, with laws relating to them.

In Acharnians a small landowner, tired of the Peloponnesian War, magically arranges a personal peace treaty and, borrowing a disguise from Euripides, demonstrates the injustice of the war in a contest with the bellicose Acharnians.

In this third volume of a new Loeb Classical Library edition of Aristophanes, Jeffrey Henderson presents a freshly edited Greek text and a lively, unexpurgated translation of three plays with full explanatory notes. In Birds Aristophanes turns from the pointed political satire characteristic of earlier plays to a fantasy that soars literally into the air in search of a carefree world. Here the enterprising protagonists create a utopian counter-Athens, called Cloudcuckooland, ruled by birds. Lysistrata blends boisterous comedy and an earnest call for peace. Lysistrata, our first comic heroine, organizes a panhellenic conjugal strike of young wives until their husbands end the war between Athens and Sparta. Athenian women again take center stage in Women at the Thesmophoria, this time to punish Euripides for portraying them as wicked. Parody of Euripides' plots enlivens this witty confrontation of the sexes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAristophanesvTranslations into English. 0aBirdsvDrama. 0aGreek drama (Comedy)vTranslations into English. 7aGreek drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)947136.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 0aAthens (Greece)xSocial life and customsvDrama. 0aGreecexHistoryyPeloponnesian War, 431 B.C.-404 B.C.vDrama. 7aGreecezAthens0(OCoLC)1204474.2fast02aAristophanes,eauthor.tLysistrata.02aAristophanes,eauthor.tWomen at the Thesmophoria.1 aHenderson, Jeffrey,d1946-eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAristophanes.tBirds.

This is the fourth and final volume in the new Loeb Classical Library edition of his plays. Frogs was produced in 405 BCE, shortly after the deaths of Sophocles and Euripides. Dionysus, the patron god of theater, journeys to the underworld to retrieve Euripides. There he is recruited to judge a contest between the traditional Aeschylus and the modern Euripides, a contest that yields both sparkling comedy and insight on ancient literary taste. In Assemblywomen Athenian women plot to save Athens from male misgovernance. They transfer power to themselves and institute a new social order in which all inequalities based on wealth, age, and beauty are eliminated--with raucously comical results. The gentle humor and straightforward morality of Wealth made it the most popular of Aristophanes' plays from classical times to the Renaissance. Here the god Wealth is cured of his blindness; his newfound ability to distinguish good people from bad brings playfully portrayed social consequences.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAristophanesvTranslations into English. 0aGreek drama (Comedy)vTranslations into English. 7aGreek drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)947136.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aGreecezAthens0(OCoLC)1204474.2fast02aAristophanes,eauthor.tAssemblywomen.02aAristophanes,eauthor.tWealth.1 aHenderson, Jeffrey,d1946-eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAristophanes.tFrogs.

He is the author of the great didactic poem in hexameters, De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things). In six books compounded of solid reasoning, brilliant imagination, and noble poetry, he expounds the scientific theories of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, with the aim of dispelling fear of the gods and fear of death and so enabling man to attain peace of mind and happiness. In Book 1 he establishes the general principles of the atomic system, refutes the views of rival physicists, and proves the infinity of the universe and of its two ultimate constituents, matter and void. In Book 2 he explains atomic movement, the variety of atomic shapes, and argues that the atoms lack colour, sensation, and other secondary qualities. In Book 3 he expounds the nature and composition of mind and spirit, proves their mortality, and argues that there is nothing to fear in death. Book 4 explains the nature of sensation and thought, and ends with an impressive account of sexual love. Book 5 describes the nature and formation of our world, astronomical phenomena, the beginnings of life on earth, and the development of civilization. In Book 6 the poet explains various atmospheric and terrestrial phenomena, including thunder, lightning, earthquakes, volcanoes, the magnet, and plagues. The work is distinguished by the fervour and poetry of the author.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aDidactic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aPhilosophy, Ancient. 7aDidactic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)893018.2fast 7aLatin poetry0(OCoLC)993373.2fast 7aNatural history0(OCoLC)1034268.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aPoetry0(OCoLC)1067691.2fast 7aScience0(OCoLC)1108176.2fast1 aRouse, W.

The Constitution of the Athenians, though not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on Athenian politics.bXenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE) was a wealthy Athenian and friend of Socrates. He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this "March Up-Country" (Anabasis); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth. Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. Hellenica, a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In Memorabilia Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's Symposium portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and Oeconomicus has him giving advice on household management and married life. Cyropaedia, a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes. We also have his Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon (on the Spartan system); Ways and Means (on the finances of Athens); Manual for a Cavalry Commander; a good manual of Horsemanship; and a lively Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek literature. 7aCivilization0(OCoLC)862898.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aIran0(OCoLC)1204889.2fast02aXenophon,eauthor.tAgesilaus.02aXenophon,eauthor.tConstitution of the Lacedaemonians.02aXenophon,eauthor.tWays and means.02aXenophon,eauthor.tCavalry commander.02aXenophon,eauthor.tArt of horsemanship.02aXenophon,eauthor.tOn hunting.02aXenophon,eauthor.tConstitution of the Athenians.1 aBowersock, G.

Diogenes Laertius carefully compiled his information from hundreds of sources and enriches his accounts with numerous quotations. Diogenes Laertius lived probably in the earlier half of the 3rd century CE, his ancestry and birthplace being unknown. His history, in ten books, is divided unscientifically into two "Successions" or sections: "Ionian" from Anaximander to Theophrastus and Chrysippus, including the Socratic schools; "Italian" from Pythagoras to Epicurus, including the Eleatics and sceptics. It is a very valuable collection of quotations and facts. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Diogenes Laertius is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPhilosophers, Ancient. 0aPhilosophy, Ancient. 7aPhilosophers, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060760.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast1 aHicks, Robert Drew,d1850-1929,etranslator.08iPrint version:aDiogenes Laertius.tLives of eminent philosophers.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1925z9780674992030(v.1)z9780674992047(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v184-185.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL184/1925/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL185/1925/volume.xml02943nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100003200271245011800303260005400421300002900475490003500504500002200539520125700561538003601818546006001854588004701914600002301961650002301984650003602007650003102043650004402074650003402118700004802152700007002200776013102270830003602401856006002437hup0000286MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1926    maub   go     00| e eng d  z9780674992054qprint version  a(OCoLC)651945758  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.J674 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aHIS0220002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aJosephus, Flavius,eauthor.14aThe lifeh[electronic resource] ; bAgainst Apion /cJosephus ; with an English translation by H.St.J.

Also by him are an autobiographical Life and a treatise Against Apion.bJosephus, soldier, statesman, historian, was a Jew born at Jerusalem about 37 CE. A man of high descent, he early became learned in Jewish law and Greek literature and was a Pharisee. After pleading in Rome the cause of some Jewish priests he returned to Jerusalem and in 66 tried to prevent revolt against Rome, managing for the Jews the affairs of Galilee. In the troubles which followed he made his peace with Vespasian. Present at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, he received favours from these two as emperors and from Domitian and assumed their family name Flavius. He died after 97. As a historical source Josephus is invaluable. His major works are: History of the Jewish War, in seven books, from 170 BCE to his own time, first written in Aramaic but translated by himself into the Greek we now have; and Jewish Antiquities, in twenty books, from the creation of the world to 66 CE.

Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aLawvEarly works to 1800. 7aClassical literature0(OCoLC)863509.2fast 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aState, The0(OCoLC)1131943.2fast 7aUtopias0(OCoLC)1163359.2fast1 aBury, Robert Gregg,d1869-etranslator.08iPrint version:aPlato.tLaws.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1926z9780674992061(v.1)z9780674996519(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v187-192.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL187/1926/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL192/1926/volume.xml03884nam a22005534a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274072002300297100003700320240003400357245009900391250006200490260005400552300003000606490004000636504003700676505002900713520149200742538003602234546006002270588004702330600006202377600005502439650006502494650004302559650004402602650004502646650003702691650006002728651004102788700004402829700005202873700007702925776015703002830004103159856006503200856006503265hup0000289MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2010    maub   gob    00| s eng d  z9780674996342q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995895q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)905184017  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6280b.C534 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLCO0030002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.10aPhilippicae.lEnglish & Latin10aPhilippicsh[electronic resource] /cCicero ; edited and translated by D.R.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman advocate, orator, politician, poet, and philosopher, about whom we know more than we do of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era that saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In Cicero's political speeches and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, 58 survive (a few incompletely), 29 of which are addressed to the Roman people or Senate, the rest to jurors. In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters, of which more than 800 were written by Cicero, and nearly 100 by others to him. This correspondence affords a revelation of the man, all the more striking because most of the letters were not intended for publication. Six works on rhetorical subjects survive intact and another in fragments. Seven major philosophical works are extant in part or in whole, and there are a number of shorter compositions either preserved or known by title or fragments. Of his poetry, some is original, some translated from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aAntonius, Marcus,d83?

His reform of monastic life in the east is the basis of modern Greek and Slavonic monasteries.bBasil the Great was born ca. 330 CE at Caesarea in Cappadocia into a family noted for piety. He was at Constantinople and Athens for several years as a student with Gregory of Nazianzus and was much influenced by Origen. For a short time he held a chair of rhetoric at Caesarea, and was then baptized. He visited monasteries in Egypt and Palestine and sought out the most famous hermits in Syria and elsewhere to learn how to lead a pious and ascetic life; but he decided that communal monastic life and work were best. About 360 he founded in Pontus a convent to which his sister and widowed mother belonged. Ordained a presbyter in 365, in 370 he succeeded Eusebius in the archbishopric of Caesarea, which included authority over all Pontus. He died in 379.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

In the Satires Horace mocks himself as well as the world. His verse epistles include the Art of Poetry, in which he famously expounds his literary theory.bHorace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus, 65-8 BCE) was born at Venusia, son of a freedman clerk who had him well educated at Rome and Athens. Horace supported the ill-fated killers of Caesar, lost his property, became a secretary in the Treasury, and began to write poetry. Maecenas, lover of literature, to whom Virgil and Varius introduced Horace in 39, became his friend and made him largely independent by giving him a farm. After 30 Horace knew and aided with his pen the emperor Augustus, who after Virgil's death in 19 engaged him to celebrate imperial affairs in poetry. Horace refused to become Augustus's private secretary and died a few months after Maecenas. Both lyric (in various metres) and other work (in hexameters) was spread over the period 40-10 or 9 BCE. It is Roman in spirit, Greek in technique. In the two books of Satires Horace is a moderate social critic and commentator; the two books of Epistles are more intimate and polished, the second book being literary criticism as is also the Ars Poetica. The Epodes in various (mostly iambic) metres are akin to the "discourses" (as Horace called his satires and epistles) but also look towards the famous Odes, in four books, in the old Greek lyric metres used with much skill. Some are national odes about public affairs; some are pleasant poems of love and wine; some are moral letters; all have a rare perfection. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the Odes and Epodes is in volume number 33.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aHoracevTranslations into English. 7aAesthetics, Ancient0(OCoLC)798742.2fast 7aCriticism0(OCoLC)883735.2fast 7aEpistolary poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)914353.2fast 7aLatin language0(OCoLC)993125.2fast 7aPoetics0(OCoLC)1067682.2fast 7aVerse satire, Latin0(OCoLC)1165504.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast02aHorace,eauthor.tEpistles.02aHorace,eauthor.tThe art of poetry.1 aFairclough, H.

The work collects in twenty books (of Book VIII only the index is extant) interesting notes covering philosophy, history, biography, all sorts of antiquities, points of law, literary criticism, and lexicographic matters, explanations of old words and questions of grammar. The work is valuable because of its many excerpts from other authors whose works are lost; and because of its evidence for people's manners and occupations. Some at least of the dramatic settings may be genuine occasions.

They reflect his philosophy about living a good life, and provide a treasury of information concerning Greco-Roman society, traditions, ideals, ethics, and religion.bPlutarch (Plutarchus), ca. 45-120 CE, was born at Chaeronea in Boeotia in central Greece, studied philosophy at Athens, and, after coming to Rome as a teacher in philosophy, was given consular rank by the emperor Trajan and a procuratorship in Greece by Hadrian. He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned. Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 Parallel Lives, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators. Plutarch's many other varied extant works, about 60 in number, are known as Moralia or Moral Essays. They are of high literary value, besides being of great use to people interested in philosophy, ethics and religion. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the Moralia is in fifteen volumes, volume XIII having two parts.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEthicsvEarly works to 1800. 0aEthics, AncientvIndexes. 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aEthics, Ancient0(OCoLC)915866.2fast 7aGreek prose literature0(OCoLC)947525.2fast 7aPhilosophy0(OCoLC)1060777.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aBabbitt, Frank Cole,etranslator.1 aCherniss, Harold F.q(Harold Fredrik),d1904-1987,etranslator.1 aClement, Paul A.etranslator.1 aDe Lacy, Phillip,d1913-2006,etranslator.1 aEinarson, Benedict,d1906-1978,etranslator.1 aFowler, Harold North,d1859-1955,etranslator.1 aHelmbold, W.

The subject of On the Sublime, attributed to an (unidentifiable) "Longinus" and probably composed in the first century CE is greatness in writing. On Style, attributed to an (unidentifiable) "Demetrius" and perhaps composed in the second century BCE, analyzes four literary styles.bThis volume brings together the three most influential ancient Greek treatises on literature. Aristotle's Poetics contains his treatment of Greek tragedy: its history, nature, and conventions, with details on poetic diction. Stephen Halliwell makes this seminal work newly accessible with a reliable text and a translation that is both accurate and readable. His authoritative introduction traces the work's debt to earlier theorists (especially Plato), its distinctive argument, and the reasons behind its enduring relevance. The essay On the Sublime, usually attributed to "Longinus" (identity uncertain), was probably composed in the first century CE; its subject is the appreciation of greatness (the sublime) in writing, with analysis of illustrative passages ranging from Homer and Sappho to Plato. In this edition, Donald A. Russell has revised and newly annotated the text and translation by W. Hamilton Fyfe, and supplied a new introduction. The treatise On Style, ascribed to an (again unidentifiable) "Demetrius," was perhaps composed during the secod century BCE. It is notable particularly for its theory and analysis of four distinct styles (grand, elegant, plain, and forceful). Doreen Innes's fresh rendering of the work is based on the earlier Loeb translation by W. Rhys Roberts. Her new introduction and notes represent the latest scholarship.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAesthetics, Ancient. 0aGreek literaturevTranslations into English. 0aGreek literaturexHistory and criticismxTheory, etc. 0aLiterary formvEarly works to 1800. 0aStyle, LiteraryvEarly works to 1800. 0aSublime, The. 7aAesthetics0(OCoLC)798702.2fast 7aAesthetics, Ancient0(OCoLC)798742.2fast 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aLiterary form0(OCoLC)999924.2fast 7aPoetry0(OCoLC)1067691.2fast 7aRhetoric, Ancient0(OCoLC)1096982.2fast 7aStyle, Literary0(OCoLC)1136323.2fast 7aSublime, The0(OCoLC)1136594.2fast0 aLonginus,dactive 1st century,eauthor.tOn the sublime.0 aDemetrius,eauthor.tOn style.1 aFyfe, W.

Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPhilosophers, AncientzGreek. 0aPhilosophers, Ancient. 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aPhilosophers0(OCoLC)1060746.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aPolitical and social views0(OCoLC)1353986.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aUtopias0(OCoLC)1163359.2fast02aPlato,eauthor.tAlcibiades I and II.02aPlato,eauthor.tHipparchus.02aPlato,eauthor.tThe lovers.02aPlato,eauthor.tTheages.02aPlato,eauthor.tMinos.02aPlato,eauthor.tEpinomis.1 aLamb, W.

Of at least fifty attributed orations, there survive eleven on legacy cases and a large fragment dealing with a claim of citizenship.bThough he occupies a firm place in the canon of the ten Attic orators, Isaeus seems not to have been an Athenian, but a metic, being a native of Chalcis in Euboea. From passages in his work he is inferred to have lived from about 420 to 350 BCE. But no contemporary mentions him, and it is from Dionysius of Halicarnassus that we learn he was the teacher of Demosthenes, a fact confirmed by several unmistakable examples of borrowing from or imitation of him by his great pupil. Isaeus took no part in politics, but composed speeches for others, particularly in cases of inheritance. While he shares with Lysias the merits of a pure Attic and a lucidity of style, Isaeus is more aggressive and more flexible in his presentation; and in these respects he undoubtedly influenced Demosthenes.

Also by him are an autobiographical Life and a treatise Against Apion.bJosephus, soldier, statesman, historian, was a Jew born at Jerusalem about 37 CE. A man of high descent, he early became learned in Jewish law and Greek literature and was a Pharisee. After pleading in Rome the cause of some Jewish priests he returned to Jerusalem and in 66 tried to prevent revolt against Rome, managing for the Jews the affairs of Galilee. In the troubles which followed he made his peace with Vespasian. Present at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, he received favours from these two as emperors and from Domitian and assumed their family name Flavius. He died after 97. As a historical source Josephus is invaluable. His major works are: History of the Jewish War, in seven books, from 170 BCE to his own time, first written in Aramaic but translated by himself into the Greek we now have; and Jewish Antiquities, in twenty books, from the creation of the world to 66 CE. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the works of Josephus also includes the autobiographical Life and his treatise Against Apion.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aJewsxHistoryy168 B.C.-135 A.D. 0aJewsxHistoryyRebellion, 66-73. 7aJews0(OCoLC)983135.2fast1 aThackeray, H.

The work (which dates to the very end of the second century CE) is amusing reading and of extraordinary value as a treasury of quotations from works now lost. Athenaeus also preserves a wide range of information about different cuisines and foodstuffs; the music and entertainments that ornamented banquets; and the intellectual talk that was the heart of Greek conviviality. S. Douglas Olson has undertaken to produce a complete new edition of the work, replacing the previous seven-volume Loeb Athenaeus (published under the title Deipnosophists).  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAphorisms and apothegmsvEarly works to 1800. 0aGastronomyvEarly works to 1800. 7aAphorisms and apothegms0(OCoLC)811330.2fast1 aOlson, S.

Among classical texts this correspondence is unparalleled; nowhere else do we get such an intimate look at the life of a prominent Roman and his social world, or such a vivid sense of a momentous period in Roman history. The 435 letters collected here represent Cicero's correspondence with friends and acquaintances over a period of 20 years, from 62 BCE, when Cicero's political career was at its peak, to 43 BCE, the year he was put to death by the victorious Triumvirs. They range widely in substance and style, from official dispatches and semi-public letters of political importance to casual notes that chat with close friends about travels and projects, domestic pleasures and books, and questions currently debated. This new Loeb Classical Library edition of the Letters to Friends, in three volumes, brings together D. R. Shackleton Bailey's standard Latin text, now updated, and a revised version of his much admired translation first published by Penguin. This authoritative edition complements the new Loeb edition of Cicero's Letters to Atticus, also translated by Shackleton Bailey.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aCicero, Marcus TulliusvCorrespondence. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aElections0(OCoLC)904324.2fast 7aLatin letters0(OCoLC)993327.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aStatesmen0(OCoLC)1131990.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aShackleton Bailey, D.

His Silvae are thirty-two occasional poems. His masterpiece, the epic Thebaid, recounts the struggle for kingship between the two sons of Oedipus. The extant portion of his Achilleid begins an account of Achilles' life and renews epic.bStatius' Silvae, thirty-two occasional poems, were written probably between 89 and 96 CE Here the poet congratulates friends, consoles mourners, offers thanks, admires a monument or artistic object, describes a memorable scene. The verse is light in touch, with a distinct picture quality. Statius gives us in these impromptu poems clear images of Domitian's Rome. Statius was raised in the Greek cultural milieu of the Bay of Naples, and his Greek literary education lends a sophisticated veneer to his ornamental verse. The role of the emperor and the imperial circle in determining taste is another readily apparent influence: the figure of the emperor Domitian permeates these poems. D. R. Shackleton Bailey's new edition of the Silvae, a freshly edited Latin text facing a graceful translation, replaces the earlier Loeb Classical Library edition with translation by J. H. Mozley. Kathleen M. Coleman contributed an essay on recent scholarship on the Silvae.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aEpic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aOccasional verse, LatinvTranslations into English. 7aEpic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)913954.2fast 7aOccasional verse, Latin0(OCoLC)1043062.2fast 0aRomexHistoryyDomitian, 81-96vPoetry. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aShackleton Bailey, D.

His masterpiece, the epic Thebaid, recounts the struggle for kingship between the two sons of Oedipus. The extant portion of his Achilleid begins an account of Achilles's life and renews epic.bStatius published his Thebaid in the last decade of the first century. This epic recounting the struggle between the two sons of Oedipus for the kingship of Thebes is his masterpiece, a stirring exploration of the passions of civil war. The extant portion of his unfinished Achilleid is strikingly different in tone: this second epic begins as a charming account of Achilles' life. Statius was raised in the Greek cultural milieu of the Bay of Naples, and his Greek literary education is reflected in his poetry. The political realities of Rome in the first century are also evident in the Thebaid, in representations of authoritarian power and the drive for domination. This two-volume edition of the epics, a freshly edited Latin text facing a graceful translation, completes D. R. Shackleton Bailey's new Loeb Classical Library edition of Statius. Kathleen M. Coleman contributed an essay on recent scholarship on the two epics.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aEteocles,cKing of Thebes (Mythological character)vPoetry.00aPolynicesc(Greek mythological figure)vPoetry. 0aEpic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aSeven against Thebes (Greek mythology)vPoetry. 7aAchilles (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)795683.2fast 7aEpic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)913954.2fast 7aEteocles (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)915771.2fast 7aOccasional verse, Latin0(OCoLC)1043062.2fast 7aPolyneices (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1070677.2fast 7aSeven against Thebes (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1113646.2fast 0aThebes (Greece)vPoetry. 7aGreecezThebes0(OCoLC)1229872.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aShackleton Bailey, D.

Nine letters, more on public than private matters, are also extant.bThe importance of Isocrates for the study of Greek civilisation of the fourth century BCE is indisputable. From 403 to 393 he wrote speeches for Athenian law courts, and then became a teacher of composition for would-be orators. After setting up a school of rhetoric in Chios he returned to Athens and established there a free school of "philosophia" involving a practical education of the whole mind, character, judgment, and mastery of language. This school had famous pupils from all over the Greek world, such as the historians Ephorus and Theopompus and orators Isaeus, Lycurgus, and Hypereides. Isocrates also wrote in gifted style essays on political questions, his main idea being a united Greece to conquer the Persian empire. Thus in his fine Panegyricus (written for the 100th Olympiad gathering in 380) he urged that the leadership should be granted to Athens, possibly in conjunction with Sparta. In the end he looked to Philip of Macedon, but died just as Philip's supremacy in Greece began. Twenty-one discourses by Isocrates survive; these include political essays, treatises on education and on ethics, and speeches for legal cases. Nine letters are also extant; they are concerned more with public than with private matters. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Isocrates is in three volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aIsocratesvTranslations into English. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., GreekvTranslations into English. 7aOrators0(OCoLC)1047212.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Greek0(OCoLC)1129363.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 7aGreecezAthens0(OCoLC)1204474.2fast1 aNorlin, George,d1871-1942,etranslator.1 aVan Hook, Larue,etranslator.08iPrint version:aIsocrates.sWorks.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1928z9780674992313(v.1)z9780674992528(v.2)z9780674994119(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v209, 229, 373.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL209/1928/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL229/1929/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL373/1945/volume.xml03303nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002500179072002300204072002300227072002300250100003700273245011700310246003300427260005400460300002200514490003500536500002000571520140600591538003601997546006002033588004702093650004402140650004902184650003002233650004502263650006002308650003802368651003502406651004102441700005002482700005202532776014102584830003602725856006002761hup0000313MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1928    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674992351qprint version  a(OCoLC)756452707  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156.C6bC534 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh1 aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.10aDe re publicah[electronic resource] ; bDe legibus /cCicero ; with an English translation by Clinton W.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPolitical sciencexEarly works to 1800. 7aLatin prose literature0(OCoLC)993390.2fast 7aLaw0(OCoLC)993678.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Latin0(OCoLC)1129386.2fast 7aState, The0(OCoLC)1131943.2fast 0aRomexPolitics and government. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tDe legibus.1 aKeyes, Clinton Walker,d1888-1943,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tOn the republic.

He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle. We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)-on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness- and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, Apocolocyntosis (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost. His moral essays are collected in Volumes I-III of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aConduct of lifevEarly works to 1800. 0aPolitical ethicsxEarly works to 1800. 7aBenevolence0(OCoLC)830340.2fast 7aConduct of life0(OCoLC)874563.2fast 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aPolitical ethics0(OCoLC)1069286.2fast 7aStoics0(OCoLC)1133750.2fast1 aBasore, John W.q(John William),d1870-etranslator.08iPrint version:aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, approximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.tMoral essays.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1928z9780674992368(v.1)z9780674995031(v.2)z9780674993433(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v214, 254, 310.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL214/1928/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL254/1932/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL310/1935/volume.xml03301nam a22004934a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100004200248245010800290260005400398300002200452490003500474504003900509520146900548538003602017546006002053588004702113650002902160650001302189650001302202650001302215650003202228650003402260650003402294650003402328650003402362650003502396700003802431700002702469700006302496776015202559830003602711856006002747hup0000319MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1928    mau    gob    00| e eng d  z9780674992412qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735734  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA4253b.O675 2014 7aHIS0020002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aOppian,dactive 2nd century,eauthor.10aOppianh[electronic resource] ; bColluthus ; Tryphiodorus /cwith an English translation by A.W.

The Chase, on hunting, may be the work of a Syrian imitator. Colluthus and Tryphiodorus (properly "Triphiodorus"), epic poets of Egypt, wrote in the second half of the fifth century CE.bOppian of Cilicia flourished in the latter half of the 2nd century, and dedicated his Fishing (in five books) to "Antoninus," presumably Marcus Aurelius. It deals with the habits and characteristics of fish as well as giving instructions for fishing: if not exactly poetical, it contains a great deal of curious information. The Chase, dedicated to Caracalla, is an inferior composition and may even be the work of a Syrian imitator. The first book gives an appreciation of the huntsman's horses and hounds, the three remaining being devoted to the hunting of wild animals, from the lion to the hare. This edition is equipped with extensive zoological and ichthyological notes. This volume also includes the extant work of two epic poets of Egypt who wrote in the second half of the 5th century under the influence of Nonnus. The Rape of Helen of Colluthus in 394 lines is a pleasant account of the Judgement of Paris and Helen's elopement with him; Tryphiodorus (papyri reveal the correct spelling to be "Triphiodorus") deals with The Taking of Troy in 691 lines, beginning with the Wooden Horse and ending with the sacrifice of Polyxena.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAnimalsvClassification. 0aFishing. 0aFowling. 0aHunting. 0aZoologyvPre-Linnean works. 7aAnimals0(OCoLC)809468.2fast 7aFishing0(OCoLC)926650.2fast 7aFowling0(OCoLC)933446.2fast 7aHunting0(OCoLC)964162.2fast 7aZoology0(OCoLC)1184696.2fast0 aColluthus, of Lycopolis,eauthor.0 aTryphiodorus,eauthor.1 aMair, A.

The poem is also called Pharsalia.bLucan (M. Annaeus Lucanus, 39-65 CE), son of wealthy M. Annaeus Mela and nephew of Seneca, was born at Corduba (Cordova) in Spain and was brought as a baby to Rome. In 60 CE at a festival in Emperor Nero's honour Lucan praised him in a panegyric and was promoted to one or two minor offices. But having defeated Nero in a poetry contest he was interdicted from further recitals or publication, so that three books of his epic The Civil War were probably not issued in 61 when they were finished. By 65 he was composing the tenth book but then became involved in the unsuccessful plot of Piso against Nero and, aged only twenty-six, by order took his own life. Quintilian called Lucan a poet "full of fire and energy and a master of brilliant phrases." His epic stood next after Virgil's in the estimation of antiquity. Julius Caesar looms as a sinister hero in his stormy chronicle in verse of the war between Caesar and the Republic's forces under Pompey, and later under Cato in Africa--a chronicle of dramatic events carrying us from Caesar's fateful crossing of the Rubicon, through the Battle of Pharsalus and death of Pompey, to Caesar victorious in Egypt. The poem is also called Pharsalia.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPharsalus, Battle of, Farsala, Greece, 48 B.C. 7aEpic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)913954.2fast 0aRomexHistoryyCivil War, 49 B.C.-45 B.C. 7aGreecezFarsala0(OCoLC)1296353.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aDuff, J.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aVerres, Gaius,dactive 1st century B.C. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Latin. 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Latin0(OCoLC)1129386.2fast 7aItalyzSicily0(OCoLC)1204499.2fast1 aGreenwood, L.

The Hellenistic poet Herodas wrote Mimes, in which everyday life is portrayed and character as opposed to plot depicted. Mimes by Sophron (fifth century BCE) and anonymous mime fragments also represent that genre.bThis volume collects important examples of Greek literary portraiture. The Characters of Theophrastus consists of thirty fictional sketches of men who are each dominated by a single fault, such as arrogance, boorishness, or superstition. The Hellenistic poet Herodas wrote mimes, a popular entertainment in which one actor or a small group portrayed a situation from everyday life, concentrating on depiction of character rather than on plot. The volume also includes a new translation and text of extant portions of the mimes of Sophron, a Syracusan of the fifth century BCE Here too is a selection of anonymous mime fragments. The work of Sophron and the anonymous mime fragments are newly added to the Loeb Classical Library in this second edition of a volume published in 1993.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

His Ibis is an elegiac curse-poem. Nux, Halieutica, and Consolatio ad Liviam are poems now judged not to be by Ovid.bOvid (Publius Ovidius Naso, 43 BCE-17 CE), born at Sulmo, studied rhetoric and law at Rome. Later he did considerable public service there, and otherwise devoted himself to poetry and to society. Famous at first, he offended the emperor Augustus by his Ars Amatoria, and was banished because of this work and some other reason unknown to us, and dwelt in the cold and primitive town of Tomis on the Black Sea. He continued writing poetry, a kindly man, leading a temperate life. He died in exile. Ovid's main surviving works are the Metamorphoses, a source of inspiration to artists and poets including Chaucer and Shakespeare; the Fasti, a poetic treatment of the Roman year of which Ovid finished only half; the Amores, love poems; the Ars Amatoria, not moral but clever and in parts beautiful; Heroides, fictitious love letters by legendary women to absent husbands; and the dismal works written in exile: the Tristia, appeals to persons including his wife and also the emperor; and similar Epistulae ex Ponto. Poetry came naturally to Ovid, who at his best is lively, graphic and lucid.

Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, was born in 427 BCE. In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of "advanced" democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.

Acknowledged masterpieces among his works are the Symposium, which explores love in its many aspects, from physical desire to pursuit of the beautiful and the good, and the Republic, which concerns righteousness and also treats education, gender, society, and slavery.bPlato of Athens, who laid the foundations of the Western philosophical tradition and in range and depth ranks among its greatest practitioners, was born to a prosperous and politically active family ca. 427 bce. In early life an admirer of Socrates, Plato later founded the first institution of higher learning in the West, the Academy, among whose many notable alumni was Aristotle. Traditionally ascribed to Plato are thirty-six dialogues developing Socrates' dialectic method and composed with great stylistic virtuosity, together with thirteen letters. Republic, a masterpiece of philosophical and political thought, concerns righteousness both in individuals and in communities, and proposes an ideal state organized and governed on philosophical principles. This edition, which replaces the original Loeb edition by Paul Shorey, offers text, translation, and annotation that are fully current with modern scholarship. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Plato is in twelve volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPolitical sciencevEarly works to 1800. 0aUtopiasvEarly works to 1800. 7aEnglish language0(OCoLC)910920.2fast 7aEnglish literaturexExaminations0(OCoLC)912050.2fast 7aEthics0(OCoLC)915833.2fast 7aJustice0(OCoLC)985122.2fast 7aPolitical ethics0(OCoLC)1069286.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aThesauri0(OCoLC)1149946.2fast 7aUtopias0(OCoLC)1163359.2fast1 aEmlyn-Jones, C.

We possess by him political speeches and law-court speeches composed for parties in private cases and political cases. His early reputation as the best of Greek orators rests on his steadfastness of purpose, his sincerity, his clear and pungent argument, and his severe control of language. In his law cases he is the advocate, in his political speeches a castigator not of his opponents but of their politics. Demosthenes gives us vivid pictures of public and private life of his time.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals. From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the Confessions (in two volumes); City of God (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of Letters which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAugustine,cSaint, Bishop of HippoxCorrespondence.00aAugustine,cSaint, Bishop of Hippo. 0aChristian saintszAlgeriaxCorrespondence. 0aChristian saintszAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)xCorrespondence. 0aTheologyxEarly works to 1800. 0aTheologyxHistoryyEarly Church, approximately 30-600. 7aChristian saints0(OCoLC)859491.2fast 7aTheology0(OCoLC)1149559.2fast 7aTheologyxEarly church0(OCoLC)1907238.2fast 7aAlgeria0(OCoLC)1205459.2fast 7aAlgeriazHippo (Extinct city)0(OCoLC)1896881.2fast1 aBaxter, James Houston,d1894-1973,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAugustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo.tSelect letters.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1930z9780674992641 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v239.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL239/1930/volume.xml05277nam a22006614a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341035002100382040001200403041001800415050002500433072002300458072002300481100003700504240003100541245003500572260005400607300003200661490006500693504004100758505088200799520140601681538003603087546006003123588004703183600005503230650006503285650004803350650004503398650005303443650006003496651004403556651004103600700003703641700004703678700005203725700003103777700003903808776024603847830006604093856006504159856006504224856006504289856006504354856006504419856006504484856006604549hup0000340MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1930    mau    gob    00| s eng d  z9780674992658q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674992184q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674993587q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674991743q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674993419q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674994928q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674992788q(v. 7)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198873  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156.C5bC534 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.10aOrations.lEnglish & Latin10aCiceroh[electronic resource].  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource :btables1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v158, 198, 240, 252, 309, 324, 447  aIncludes bibliographies and indexes.0 av. 1.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aCicero, Marcus TulliusxTranslations into English. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., LatinxTranslations into English. 7aAgrarian laws of Rome0(OCoLC)800441.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc.0(OCoLC)1129318.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Latin0(OCoLC)1129386.2fast 0aRomexPolitics and governmentxSources. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aFreese, John Henry,etranslator.1 aGardner, R.q(Robert),d1890-etranslator.1 aGrose Hodge, H.q(Humfrey),d1891-etranslator.1 aMacdonald, C.etranslator.1 aWatts, Nevile,d1884-etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.sOrations.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1930z9780674992658(v.1)z9780674992184(v.2)z9780674993587(v.3)z9780674991743(v.4)z9780674993419(v.5)z9780674994928(v.6)z9780674992788(v.7) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v158, 198, 240, 252, 309, 324, 447.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL240/1930/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL198/1927/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL324/1976/volume.xml403v.4uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL158/1923/volume.xml403v.5uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL309/1958/volume.xml403v.6uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL447/1958/volume.xml403v.7uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL252/1931/volume.xml	05181nam a22006854a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341020004100382020004100423035002100464040001200485041001800497050002300515072002300538072002300561072002300584100003200607245005900639260005400698300005800752490007500810504003700885505073500922520125701657538003602914546006002950588004703010630007603057650003703133650003003170650003103200650004403231650003403275651003503309700003503344700004403379700007003423700005003493776029103543830007603834856006503910856006503975856006504040856006504105856006504170856006504235856006504300856006504365856006504430hup0000342MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1930    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674995758q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995369q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674995765q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674993600q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674995772q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674995383q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674995789q(v. 7)qprint version  z9780674994775q(v. 8)qprint version  z9780674995024q(v. 9)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198875  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.J674 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aHIS0220002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aJosephus, Flavius,eauthor.10aJewish antiquitiesh[electronic resource] /cJosephus.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource :btables, maps, plans, genealogies1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v242, 281, 326, 365, 410, 433, 456, 489, 490  aIncludes bibliography and index.0 av.

Also by him are an autobiographical Life and a treatise Against Apion.bJosephus, soldier, statesman, historian, was a Jew born at Jerusalem about 37 CE. A man of high descent, he early became learned in Jewish law and Greek literature and was a Pharisee. After pleading in Rome the cause of some Jewish priests he returned to Jerusalem and in 66 tried to prevent revolt against Rome, managing for the Jews the affairs of Galilee. In the troubles which followed he made his peace with Vespasian. Present at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, he received favours from these two as emperors and from Domitian and assumed their family name Flavius. He died after 97. As a historical source Josephus is invaluable. His major works are: History of the Jewish War, in seven books, from 170 BCE to his own time, first written in Aramaic but translated by himself into the Greek we now have; and Jewish Antiquities, in twenty books, from the creation of the world to 66 CE. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the works of Josephus also includes the autobiographical Life and his treatise Against Apion.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aBible.pOld TestamentxHistory of Biblical eventsvEarly works to 1800. 0aJewsxHistoryyRebellion, 66-73. 0aJewsxHistoryyTo 70 A.D. 7aJews0(OCoLC)983135.2fast 7aJewsxAntiquities0(OCoLC)983140.2fast 7aJudaism0(OCoLC)984280.2fast 0aPalestinexHistoryyTo 70 A.D.1 aFeldman, Louis H.etranslator.1 aMarcus, Ralph,d1900-1956,etranslator.1 aThackeray, H.

Being a loyal supporter of democracy, Lysias took the side of the democrats at Athens against the Thirty Tyrants in 404, supplying shields and money. After one political speech in accusation of Eratosthenes (one of the Thirty) in 405, he became at Athens a busy professional speech writer for the law courts. At the Olympic festival of 388 he denounced, with riotous results, the costly display of the embassy sent by Dionysius I of Syracuse and the domination of Sicily by Dionysius. The surviving speeches of Lysias (about thirty complete out of a very much larger number) are fluent, simple and graceful in style yet vivid in description. They suggest a passionate partisan who was also a gentle humorous man.

He was ordained deacon (691-2) and priest (702-3) of the monastery, where his whole life was spent in devotion, choral singing, study, teaching, discussion, and writing. Besides Latin he knew Greek and possibly Hebrew. Bede's theological works were chiefly commentaries, mostly allegorical in method, based with acknowledgment on Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, Gregory, and others, but bearing his own personality. In another class were works on grammar and one on natural phenomena; special interest in the vexed question of Easter led him to write about the calendar and chronology. But his most admired production is his Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation. Here a clear and simple style united with descriptive powers to produce an elegant work, and the facts diligently collected from good sources make it a valuable account. Historical also are his Lives of the Abbots of his monastery, the less successful accounts (in verse and prose) of Cuthbert, and the Letter (November 734) to Egbert his pupil, so important for our knowledge about the Church in Northumbria. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Bede's historical works is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAbbotszEnglandvBiography. 0aAbbots. 7aAbbots0(OCoLC)794221.2fast 7aCivilization, Anglo-Saxon0(OCoLC)862961.2fast 0aGreat BritainxChurch historyy449-1066. 0aGreat BritainxChurch historyyAnglo-Saxon period. 7aEngland0(OCoLC)1219920.2fast 7aGreat Britain0(OCoLC)1204623.2fast1 aKing, J.

Octavius by Minucius, an early Christian writer of unknown date, is a debate between belief and unbelief that depicts Roman religion and society.bThe African Q. Septimus Florens Tertullianus (ca. 150-222 CE), the great Christian writer, was born a soldier's son at Carthage, educated in Greek and Roman literature, philosophy, and medicine, studied law and became a pleader, remaining a clever and often tortuous arguer. At Rome he became a learned and militant Christian. After a visit to churches in Greece (and Asia Minor?) he returned to Carthage and in his writings there founded a Christian Latin language and literature, toiling to fuse enthusiasm with reason; to unite the demands of the Bible with the practice of the Church; and to continue to vindicate the Church's possession of the true doctrine in the face of unbelievers, Jews, Gnostics, and others. In some of his many works he defended Christianity, in others he attacked heretical people and beliefs; in others he dealt with morals. In this volume we present Apologeticus and De Spectaculis. Of Minucius, an early Christian writer of unknown date, we have only Octavius, a vigorous and readable debate between an unbeliever and a Christian friend of Minucius, Octavius Ianuarius, a lawyer sitting on the seashore at Ostia. Minucius himself acts as presiding judge. Octavius wins the argument. The whole work presents a picture of social and religious conditions in Rome, apparently about the end of the second century.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aApologeticsvEarly works to 1800. 0aApologeticsxHistoryyEarly church, ca. 30-600. 7aApologetics0(OCoLC)811449.2fast 7aApologeticsxEarly church0(OCoLC)1906759.2fast02aTertullian,dapproximately 160-approximately 230,eauthor.tDe Spectaculis.12aMinucius Felix, Marcus,eauthor.tOctavius.1 aGlover, T.

Topics include town planning, building materials, temples, the architectural orders, houses, pavements, mosaics, water supply, measurements, and machines.bVitruvius (Marcus V. Pollio), Roman architect and engineer, studied Greek philosophy and science and gained experience in the course of professional work. He was one of those appointed to be overseers of imperial artillery or military engines, and was architect of at least one unit of buildings for Augustus in the reconstruction of Rome. Late in life and in ill health he completed, sometime before 27 BCE, De Architectura which, after its rediscovery in the fifteenth century, was influential enough to be studied by architects from the early Renaissance to recent times. In On Architecture Vitruvius adds to the tradition of Greek theory and practice the results of his own experience. The contents of this treatise in ten books are as follows. Book 1: Requirements for an architect; town planning; design, cities, aspects; temples. 2: Materials and their treatment. Greek systems. 3: Styles. Forms of Greek temples. Ionic. 4: Styles. Corinthian, Ionic, Doric; Tuscan; altars. 5: Other public buildings (fora, basilicae, theatres, colonnades, baths, harbours). 6: Sites and planning, especially of houses. 7: Construction of pavements, roads, mosaic floors, vaults. Decoration (stucco, wall painting, colours). 8: Hydraulic engineering; water supply; aqueducts. 9: Astronomy. Greek and Roman discoveries; signs of the zodiac, planets, moon phases, constellations, astrology, gnomon, sundials. 10: Machines for war and other purposes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aArchitecturexEarly works to 1800. 7aArchitecture0(OCoLC)813346.2fast1 aGranger, Frank,d1864-1936,etranslator.08iPrint version:aVitruvius Pollio.tOn architecture.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1931z9780674992771(v.1)z9780674993099(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v251, 280.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL251/1931/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL280/1934/volume.xml03412nam a22004934a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202100004700225245009100272250003800363260005400401300002200455490003500477504003700512520142900549538003601978546006002014588004702074600004702121650002802168650005102196650003002247650003502277650004902312650004302361650003602404650003902440650004802479651004102527700005702568700006102625776013602686830003602822856006002858hup0000353MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1931    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674992795qprint version  a(OCoLC)905184088  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.O953 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aOvid,d43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D.eauthor.10aFastih[electronic resource] /cOvid ; with an English translation by James G.

The poem is an invaluable source of information about religious practices.bOvid (Publius Ovidius Naso, 43 BCE-17 CE), born at Sulmo, studied rhetoric and law at Rome. Later he did considerable public service there, and otherwise devoted himself to poetry and to society. Famous at first, he offended the emperor Augustus by his Ars Amatoria, and was banished because of this work and some other reason unknown to us, and dwelt in the cold and primitive town of Tomis on the Black Sea. He continued writing poetry, a kindly man, leading a temperate life. He died in exile. Ovid's main surviving works are the Metamorphoses, a source of inspiration to artists and poets including Chaucer and Shakespeare; the Fasti, a poetic treatment of the Roman year of which Ovid finished only half; the Amores, love poems; the Ars Amatoria, not moral but clever and in parts beautiful; Heroides, fictitious love letters by legendary women to absent husbands; and the dismal works written in exile: the Tristia, appeals to persons including his wife and also the emperor; and similar Epistulae ex Ponto. Poetry came naturally to Ovid, who at his best is lively, graphic and lucid. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Ovid is in six volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aOvid,d 43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D.tFasti. 0aCalendar in literature. 0aDidactic poetry, LatinxHistory and criticism. 0aFasts and feastsvPoetry. 7aCalendar0(OCoLC)844160.2fast 7aDidactic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)893018.2fast 7aFasts and feasts0(OCoLC)921741.2fast 7aFestivals0(OCoLC)923329.2fast 7aLatin poetry0(OCoLC)993373.2fast 7aRites and ceremonies0(OCoLC)1098216.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aFrazer, James George,cSir,d1854-1941,etranslator.1 aGoold, George Patrick,d1922-2001,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aOvid, 43 B.C.-17 A.D. or 18 A.D.tFasti.bNew ed.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1931z9780674992795 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v253.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL253/1931/volume.xml03488nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100006200271245027100333260005400604300005500658490003500713504003700748520133800785538003602123546006002159588004702219650003502266650002702301650003002328650004802358650005602406650004402462650003602506650004902542700008602591700007502677700004802752776011002800830003602910856006002946hup0000356MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1931    maua   gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674992825qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198445  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.P455 2014 7aART0150602bisacsh 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aPhilostratus,cthe Lemnian,dactive 3rd century,eauthor.10aImaginesh[electronic resource] /cElder Philostratus ; with an English translation by Arthur Fairbanks.

Fourteen descriptions of statues in stone or bronze attributed to Callistratus were probably written in the fourth century CE.bThis volume presents kindred works important for evidence relating to late Greek art. They are attributed to two men each known as Philostratus and to a third man called Callistratus, otherwise unknown. To an elder Philostratus, the Lemnian, born ca. 190 CE, junior kinsman of the Philostratus who wrote the Life of Apollonius of Tyana and Lives of the Sophists, is attributed the series of 65 Eikones or Imagines--descriptions (in two books) ostensibly of paintings in a gallery at Naples. A younger Philostratus, apparently his grandson, is credited with 17 similar descriptions. The 14 Ekphraseis attributed to Callistratus are descriptions of statues in stone or bronze, written probably in the fourth century CE. It is not known to what extent the descriptions are of real works of art, but they show how artists treated their subjects, and are written with some artistic knowledge.

What survives of his works make him prominent in the revival of Greek literature in the late first and early second century CE.bDio Cocceianus Chrysostomus, ca. 40-ca. 120 CE, of Prusa in Bithynia, Asia Minor, inherited with his brothers large properties and debts from his generous father Pasicrates. He became a skilled rhetorician hostile to philosophers. But in the course of his travels he went to Rome in Vespasian's reign (69-79) and was converted to Stoicism. Strongly critical of the emperor Domitian (81-96) he was about 82 banned by him from Italy and Bithynia and wandered in poverty, especially in lands north of the Aegean, as far as the Danube and the primitive Getae. In 97 he spoke publicly to Greeks assembled at Olympia, was welcomed at Rome by emperor Nerva (96-98), and returned to Prusa. Arriving again at Rome on an embassy of thanks about 98-99 he became a firm friend of emperor Trajan. In 102 he travelled to Alexandria and elsewhere. Involved in a lawsuit about plans to beautify Prusa at his own expense, he stated his case before the governor of Bithynia, Pliny the Younger, 111-112. The rest of his life is unknown. Nearly all of Dio's extant Discourses (or Orations) reflect political concerns (the most important of them dealing with affairs in Bithynia and affording valuable details about conditions in Asia Minor) or moral questions (mostly written in later life; they contain much of his best writing). Some philosophical and historical works, including one on the Getae, are lost. What survives of his achievement as a whole makes him prominent in the revival of Greek literature in the last part of the first century and the first part of the second. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Dio Chrysostom is in five volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aDio,cChrysostomvTranslations into English. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., GreekvTranslations into English. 7aLanguage and languages0(OCoLC)992154.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Greek0(OCoLC)1129363.2fast1 aCohoon, J.

Its subject matter consists of almost any topic, excluding only the scurrilous and obscene. In this completely new Loeb Classical Library edition, Douglas Gerber provides a faithful translation of the fragments and significant testimonia that have come down to us, with full explanatory notes. Most substantial in this volume is the collection of elegiac verses to which Theognis' name is attached. Drinking and merry-making are frequent themes in these poems; there are also more reflective and philosophic pieces and love poems. Together they offer an interesting picture of an aristocratic man's views about life, friendship, fate, and daily concerns. Also notable in this volume is the martial verse of the Spartan Tyrtaeus and the poetry of Solon, Athens' famous lawmaker.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aElegiac poetry, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aElegiac poetry, Greek. 7aElegiac poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)907819.2fast 0aGreecevPoetry. 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast1 aGerber, Douglas E.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:tGreek elegiac poetry.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1999z9780674995826 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v258.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL258/1999/volume.xml02734nam a22003974a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002600179072002300205072002300228072002300251245014100274260005400415300002200469490003500491504002700526505014500553520112100698538003601819546006001855588004701915650005301962650002602015650004702041700004502088776010702133830003602240856006002276hup0000359MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1999    mau    gob    00| 0beng d  z9780674995819qprint version  a(OCoLC)647576020  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3623.E44bA734 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aLIT0140002bisacsh 7aPOE0080002bisacsh00aGreek iambic poetryh[electronic resource] : bFrom the seventh to the fifth centuries BC /cedited and translated by Douglas E.

The purpose of these poems is unclear, but they seem to have some connection with cult songs used in religious festivals--for example, those honoring Dionysus and Demeter. In this completely new Loeb Classical Library edition of early Greek iambic poetry, Douglas Gerber provides a faithful and fully annotated translation of the fragments that have come down to us. Archilochus expressed himself in colorful and vigorous language. Famous throughout antiquity for his winged barbs, he is often considered the archetypal poet of blame. Other major poets in this volume are Semonides, best known for a long misogynistic poem describing ten types of wives; and Hipponax, who was much admired by the poets of Hellenistic Alexandria, in part for his depictions of the licentious and seamy side of society.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aIambic poetry, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aIambic poetry, Greek. 7aIambic poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)966426.2fast1 aGerber, Douglas E.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:tGreek iambic poetry.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1999z9780674995819 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v259.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL259/1999/volume.xml03306nam a22004094a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100004200271240005100313245009800364260005400462300002200516490003500538500002000573520170500593538003602298546006002334588004702394600005102441650004302492650007002535700006202605776013302667830003602800856006002836hup0000362MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1933    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674992887qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735770  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.W754 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aREL0150002bisacsh1 aJerome,cSaint,d-419 or 420eauthor.10aSelect letters of St. Jerome.lEnglish & Latin10aSelect lettersh[electronic resource] /cJerome ; with an English translation by F.A.

He travelled widely in Gaul and in Asia Minor; and turned in the years 373-379 to hermetic life in Syria. Ordained presbyter at Antioch in 379 he went to Constantinople, met Gregory of Nazianzus and advanced greatly in scholarship. He was called to Rome in 382 to help Pope Damasus, at whose suggestion he began his revision of the Old Latin translation of the Bible (which came to form the core of the Vulgate version). Meanwhile he taught scripture and Hebrew and monastic living to Roman women. Wrongly suspected of luxurious habits, he left Rome (now under Pope Siricius) in 385, toured Palestine, visited Egypt, and then settled in Bethlehem, presiding over a monastery and (with help) translating the Old Testament from Hebrew. About 394 he met Augustine. He died on 30 September 420. Jerome's letters constitute one of the most notable collections in Latin literature. They are an essential source for our knowledge of Christian life in the fourth-fifth centuries; they also provide insight into one of the most striking and complex personalities of the time. Seven of the eighteen letters in this selection deal with a primary interest of Jerome's: the morals and proper role of women. The most famous letter here fervently extols virginity.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aJerome,cSaint,d-419 or 420.tCorrespondence. 7aChristian saints0(OCoLC)859491.2fast 7aChurch historyxPrimitive and early church0(OCoLC)1710945.2fast1 aWright, F.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V.

From such papyri we get much information about administration and social and economic conditions in Egypt, and about native Egyptian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine law, as well as glimpses of ordinary life. Also included are papyri relating to public business of various kinds in Egypt, including affairs in that country first when it was ruled by the Greek Ptolemaic kings, secondly when it was a Roman province. The earliest examples date from the reign of King Ptolemy II Philadelphus and the latest from the government by the Arabs after their conquest of Egypt in 639–641 CE. The papyri found in Egypt and included here have also yielded fragments large and small of ancient literary authors.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek literaturexTranslations into English. 0aGreek literature. 0aManuscripts, Greek (Papyri) 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aManuscripts, Greek (Papyri)0(OCoLC)1008356.2fast1 aHunt, Arthur S.q(Arthur Surridge),d1871-1934,etranslator.1 aEdgar, C.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGod. 7aGod0(OCoLC)944037.2fast 7aGods, Greek0(OCoLC)944264.2fast 7aGods, Roman0(OCoLC)944297.2fast 7aKnowledge, Theory of0(OCoLC)988194.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aPhilosophy, Ancient0(OCoLC)1060860.2fast 7aTheology0(OCoLC)1149559.2fast12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tAcademica.1 aRackham, H.q(Harris),d1868-1944,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tOn the nature of the Gods.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

Their value as a source for the history of thought is especially that they represent development and formulation of former sceptic doctrines.bSextus Empiricus (ca. 160-210 CE), exponent of scepticism and critic of the Dogmatists, was a Greek physician and philosopher, pupil and successor of the medical sceptic Herodotus (not the historian) of Tarsus. He probably lived for years in Rome and possibly also in Alexandria and Athens. His three surviving works are Outlines of Pyrrhonism (three books on the practical and ethical scepticism of Pyrrho of Elis, ca. 360-275 BCE, as developed later, presenting also a case against the Dogmatists); Against the Dogmatists (five books dealing with the Logicians, the Physicists, and the Ethicists); and Against the Professors (six books: Grammarians, Rhetors, Geometers, Arithmeticians, Astrologers, and Musicians). These two latter works might be called a general criticism of professors of all arts and sciences. Sextus's work is a valuable source for the history of thought especially because of his development and formulation of former sceptic doctrines.

It also echoes poets, especially Virgil, and employs techniques traditional in Latin epic.bSilius (T. Catius Silius Italicus), 25 CE-101, was consul in 68 and governor of the province of Asia in 69; he sought no further office but lived thereafter on his estates as a literary man and collector. He revered the work of Cicero, whose Tusculan villa he owned, and that of Virgil, whose tomb at Naples he likewise owned and near which he lived. His epic Punica, in 17 books, on the second War with Carthage (218-202 BCE), is based for facts largely on Livy's account. Conceived as a contrast between two great nations (and their supporting gods), championed by the two great heroes Scipio and Hannibal, his poem is written in pure Latin and smooth verse filled throughout with echoes of Virgil above all (and other poets); it exploits with easy grace, but little genius, all the devices and techniques of traditional Latin epic. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Silius Italicus is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPunic War, 2nd, 218 B.C.-201 B.C.xPoetry 0aPunic War, 2nd, 218-201 B.C.vPoetry. 7aTunisiazCarthage (Extinct city)0(OCoLC)1896920.2fast1 aDuff, J.

The work is in three parts: mythical history to the Trojan War; history to Alexander's death (323 BCE); history to 54 BCE. Books 1-5 and 11-20 survive complete, the rest in fragments.bDiodorus Siculus, Greek historian of Agyrium in Sicily, ca. 80-20 BCE, wrote forty books of world history, called Library of History, in three parts: mythical history of peoples, non-Greek and Greek, to the Trojan War; history to Alexander's death (323 BCE); history to 54 BCE. Of this we have complete Books I-V (Egyptians, Assyrians, Ethiopians, Greeks) and Books XI-XX (Greek history 480-302 BCE); and fragments of the rest. He was an uncritical compiler, but used good sources and reproduced them faithfully. He is valuable for details unrecorded elsewhere, and as evidence for works now lost, especially writings of Ephorus, Apollodorus, Agatharchides, Philistus, and Timaeus. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Diodorus Siculus is in twelve volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aHistory, Ancient. 7aGreek language0(OCoLC)947178.2fast 7aHistory, Ancient0(OCoLC)958352.2fast1 aGeer, Russel M.q(Russel Mortimer),etranslator.1 aOldfather, Charles Henry,d1887-etranslator.1 aSherman, Charles Lawton,d1894-etranslator.1 aWalton, Francis R.,d1910-etranslator.1 aWelles, C.

Varro's Res rustica (37 BCE) is not a practical treatise but instruction, in dialogue form, about agricultural life meant for prosperous country gentlemen.bCato (M. Porcius Cato) the elder (234-149 BCE) of Tusculum, statesman and soldier, was the first important writer in Latin prose. His speeches, works on jurisprudence and the art of war, his precepts to his son on various subjects, and his great historical work on Rome and Italy are lost. But we have his De Agricultura; terse, severely wise, grimly humorous, it gives rules in various aspects of a farmer's economy, including even medical and cooking recipes, and reveals interesting details of domestic life. Varro (M. Terentius), 116-27 BCE, of Reate, renowned for his vast learning, was an antiquarian, historian, philologist, student of science, agriculturist, and poet. He was a republican who was reconciled to Julius Caesar and was marked out by him to supervise an intended national library. Of Varro's more than seventy works involving hundreds of volumes we have only one on agriculture and country affairs (Rerum Rusticarum) and part of his work on the Latin language (De Lingua Latina; Loeb nos. 333, 334), though we know much about his Satires. Each of the three books on country affairs begins with an effective mise en scene and uses dialogue. The first book deals with agriculture and farm management, the second with sheep and oxen, the third with poultry and the keeping of other animals large and small, including bees and fishponds. There are lively interludes and a graphic background of political events.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAgriculturexEarly works to 1800. 7aAgriculture0(OCoLC)801355.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aVarro, Marcus Terentius,eauthor.1 aAsh, Harrison Boyd,d1891-etranslator.1 aHooper, William Davis,d1868-1945,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCato, Marcus Porcius, 234 B.C.-149 B.C.tOn agriculture.bRev.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1934z9780674993136 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v283.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL283/1934/volume.xml03596nam a22005894a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274072002300297245011300320260005400433300002200487490004000509505024400549520101800793538003601811546006001847588004701907650004501954650001801999650004102017650003902058700002002097700002202117700004002139700003702179700003402216700004902250700002702299700005102326700002202377700005702399700004602456700006502502700002502567700005402592700005902646776013002705830004102835856006502876856006502941hup0000384MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1934    mau    go     00| p eng d  z9780674993143q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674994782q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)761362072  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.A386 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPOE0080002bisacsh00aMinor Latin poetsh[electronic resource] /cwith an English translation by J.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V.

Valerius effectively rehandles the story already told by Apollonius Rhodius, recalls Virgilian language and thought, displays learning, and alludes to contemporary Rome.bValerius Flaccus, Gaius, Latin poet who flourished in the period ca. 70-90 CE, composed in smooth and sometimes obscure style an incomplete epic Argonautica in eight books, on the Quest for the Golden Fleece. The poem is typical of his age, being a free re-handling of the story already told by Apollonius Rhodius, to whom he is superior in arrangement, vividness, and description of character. Valerius's poem shows much imitation of the language and thought of Virgil, and much learning. The chief interest of the epic lies in the relationship between Medea and Jason, especially the growth of Medea's love, where Valerius is at his best. The long series of adventures and various Roman allusions suggest that the poet meant to do honour to Vespasian (to whom the epic is dedicated) with special reference to that emperor's ships in waters around Britain.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aMedea,cconsort of Aegeus, King of Athens (Mythological character)vPoetry. 0aArgonauts (Greek mythology) 0aArgonauts (Greek mythology)vPoetry. 0aEpic poetry, LatinvTranslations into English. 0aJason (Greek mythology)vPoetry. 7aArgonauts (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)814328.2fast 7aEpic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)913954.2fast 7aJason (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)982024.2fast 7aMedea (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1013568.2fast1 aMozley, J.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII.

Book I is on Greek schools of medicine and dietetics; Book II on prognosis, diagnosis, and general therapeutics; Book III on internal ailments; Book IV on local bodily diseases.bA. Cornelius Celsus was author, probably during the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius (14-37 CE), of a general encyclopaedia of agriculture, medicine, military arts, rhetoric, philosophy, and jurisprudence, in that order of subjects. Of all this great work there survives only the 8 books on medicine (De Medicina). Book I: after an excellent survey of Greek schools (Dogmatic, Methodic, Empiric) of medicine come sensible dietetics or health preservation which will always be applicable. Book II: deals with prognosis, diagnosis of symptoms (which he stresses strongly), and general therapeutics. Book III: internal ailments: fevers and general diseases. Book IV: local bodily diseases. Next come two pharmacological books, Book V: treatment by drugs of general diseases; and Book VI: of local diseases. Book VII and Book VIII deal with surgery; these books contain accounts of many operations, including amputation. Celsus was not a professional doctor of medicine or a surgeon, but a practical layman whose On Medicine, written in a clear and neat style, for lay readers, is partly a result of his medical treatment of his household (slaves included) and partly a presentation of information gained from many Greek authorities. From no other source can we learn so much of the condition of medical science up to his own time. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Celsus is in three volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMedicine, Greek and Roman. 7aMedicine, Greek and Roman0(OCoLC)1015251.2fast1 aSpencer, Walter George,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCelsus, Aulus Cornelius.tOn medicine.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1935z9780674993228(v.1)z9780674993358(v.2)z9780674993709(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v292, 304, 336.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL292/1935/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL304/1938/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL336/1938/volume.xml04359nam a22005534a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218035002100259040001200280041001800292050002300310072002300333072002300356245009900379250000900478260005400487300005500541490005000596500002000646505015400666520180300820538003602623546006002659588004702719650005902766650004102825650007102866700002902937700003302966700003702999700003003036700007703066700007703143700003103220700006403251776017903315830005103494856006503545856006503610856006503675856006503740hup0000394MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1935    mau    go     00| d eng d  z9780674993242q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674993471q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674993631q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674993969q(v. 4)qprint version  a(OCoLC)741712706  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.E565 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh00aRemains of old Latinh[electronic resource] /cwith an English translation by E.H.

He married Papianilla, daughter of the Emperor Avitus in whose honour he recited at Rome on 1 January 456 a panegyric in verse. Sidonius later joined a rebellion, it seems, but was finally reconciled to the emperor Majorian and delivered at Lyon in 458 a panegyric on him. After some years in his native land, in 467 he led a Gallo-Roman deputation to the Emperor Anthemius, and on 1 January 468 recited at Rome his third panegyric. He returned to Gaul in 469 and became Bishop of Auvergne with seat at Clermont-Ferrand. He upheld his people in resisting the Visigoths. After Auvergne was ceded to them in 475, he was imprisoned but soon resumed his bishopric. He was canonized after his death. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Sidonius is in two volumes. The first contains his poetry: the three long panegyrics; and poems addressed to or concerned with friends, apparently written in his youth. Volume I also contains two of the nine books of letters (all dating from before his episcopate); books III-IX are in volume II. Sidonius's writings shed valued light on Roman culture in the fifth century.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aSidonius Apollinaris,cSaint,d431 or 432-approximately 487. 7aBishops0(OCoLC)833378.2fast 7aChristian saints0(OCoLC)859491.2fast 7aLatin poetry0(OCoLC)993373.2fast 7aPoets, Latin0(OCoLC)1067972.2fast 7aPoets, LatinxHomes and haunts0(OCoLC)1067974.2fast 7aFrance0(OCoLC)1204289.2fast 7aFrancezClermont-Ferrand0(OCoLC)1210112.2fast1 aAnderson, W.

The portion that survives covers twenty-five years in the historian's own lifetime: the reigns of Constantius, Julian, Jovian, Valentinian I, and Valens.bAmmianus Marcellinus, ca. 325-ca. 395 CE, a Greek of Antioch, joined the army when still young and served under the governor Ursicinus and the emperor of the East Constantius II, and later under the emperor Julian, whom he admired and accompanied against the Alamanni and the Persians. He subsequently settled in Rome, where he wrote in Latin a history of the Roman empire in the period 96-378 CE, entitled Rerum Gestarum Libri XXXI. Of these 31 books only 14-31 (353-378 CE) survive, a remarkably accurate and impartial record of his own times. Soldier though he was, he includes economic and social affairs. He was broadminded towards non-Romans and towards Christianity. We get from him clear indications of causes of the fall of the Roman empire. His style indicates that his prose was intended for recitation.

He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander.

Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

Mirhady.  aAlthough Problems is an accretion of multiple authorship over several centuries, it offers a fascinating technical view of Peripatetic method and thought. bAristotle of Stagirus (384-322 BCE), the great Greek philosopher, researcher, logician, and scholar, studied with Plato at Athens and taught in the Academy (367-347). Subsequently he spent three years in Asia Minor at the court of his former pupil Hermeias, where he married Pythias, one of Hermeias' relations. After some time at Mitylene, he was appointed in 343/2 by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died the following year. Problems, the third-longest work in the Aristotelian corpus, contains thirty-eight books covering more than 900 problems about living things, meteorology, ethical and intellectual virtues, parts of the human body, and miscellaneous questions. Although Problems is an accretion of multiple authorship over several centuries, it offers a fascinating technical view of Peripatetic method and thought. Rhetoric to Alexander, which provides practical advice to orators, was likely composed during the period of Aristotle's tutorship of Alexander, perhaps by Anaximenes, another of Alexander's tutors. Both Problems and Rhetoric to Alexander replace the earlier Loeb edition by Hett and Rackham, with texts and translations incorporating the latest scholarship.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aPhilosophy, AncientvEarly works to 1800. 7aMedicine0(OCoLC)1014893.2fast 7aOratory, Ancient0(OCoLC)1047223.2fast 7aPhysics0(OCoLC)1063025.2fast 7aPhysiology0(OCoLC)1063177.2fast 7aRhetoric0(OCoLC)1096948.2fast 7aRhetoric, Ancient0(OCoLC)1096982.2fast 7aScience0(OCoLC)1108176.2fast 7aScience, Ancient0(OCoLC)1108800.2fast1 aMayhew, Robert,eeditor,etranslator.1 aMirhady, David C.,d1960-eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAristotle.tProblems.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2011z9780674996557(v.1)z9780674994829(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v316-317.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL316/2011/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL317/2011/volume.xml04236nam a22006014a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341035002100382040001200403041001800415050002300433072002300456072002300479072002300502100004300525245012200568260005400690300002200744490006500766500002000831505015700851520142301008538003602431546006002467588004702527650003802574650004502612651002302657651001902680651003502699651003902734651004102773700003902814776026002853830006603113856006503179856006503244856006503309856006503374856006503439856006503504856006503569hup0000419MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1937    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674993525q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995130q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674993945q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674994010q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674994102q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674994164q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674994270q(v. 7)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198901  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3966b.D566 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aDionysius,cof Halicarnassus,eauthor.10aRoman antiquitiesh[electronic resource] /cDionysius of Halicarnassus ; with an English translation by Earnest Cary.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v319, 347, 357, 364, 372, 378, 388  aIncludes index.0 av.

Of the twenty books (from the earliest times to 264 BCE) we have the first nine complete; most of 10 and 11; extracts; and an epitome of the whole.bDionysius of Halicarnassus was born before 53 BCE and went to Italy before 29 BCE. He taught rhetoric in Rome while studying the Latin language, collecting material for a history of Rome, and writing. His Roman Antiquities began to appear in 7 BCE. Dionysius states that his objects in writing history were to please lovers of noble deeds and to repay the benefits he had enjoyed in Rome. But he wrote also to reconcile Greeks to Roman rule. Of the 20 books of Roman Antiquities (from the earliest times to 264 BCE) we have the first 9 complete; most of 10 and 11; and later extracts and an epitome of the whole. Dionysius studied the best available literary sources (mainly annalistic and other historians) and possibly some public documents. His work and that of Livy are our only continuous and detailed independent narratives of early Roman history. Dionysius was author also of essays on literature covering rhetoric, Greek oratory, Thucydides, and how to imitate the best models in literature. The Loeb Classical Library publishes a two-volume edition of the critical essays; the edition of Roman Antiquities is in seven volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aAntiquities0(OCoLC)810745.2fast 7aPolitical science0(OCoLC)1069781.2fast 0aRomexAntiquities. 0aRomexHistory. 0aRomexPolitics and government. 7aItalyzRome0(OCoLC)1204500.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aCary, Earnest,d1879-etranslator.08iPrint version:aDionysius, of Halicarnassus.tRoman antiquities.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1937z9780674993525(v.1)z9780674995130(v.2)z9780674993945(v.3)z9780674994010(v.4)z9780674994102(v.5)z9780674994164(v.6)z9780674994270(v.7) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v319, 347, 357, 364, 372, 378, 388.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL319/1937/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL347/1939/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL357/1940/volume.xml403v.4uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL364/1943/volume.xml403v.5uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL372/1945/volume.xml403v.6uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL378/1947/volume.xml403v.7uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL388/1950/volume.xml04021nam a22004934a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002100179072002300200072002300223100002400246240004400270245016700314250000900481260005400490300003900544490003500583500002000618520200400638538003602642546006002678588004702738650002302785650003202808650003302840650003802873650004702911650004502958650004403003700004603047700004903093700006303142700005903205776016703264830003603431856006003467hup0000423MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1937    maua   go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674993570qprint version  a(OCoLC)624743560  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aB485b.A757 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aAristotle,eauthor.10aDe partibus animalium.lEnglish & Greek10aParts of animalsh[electronic resource] ; bMovement of animals ; Progression of animals /cAristotle ; with an English translation by A.L.

Terentius), 116-27 BCE, of Reate, renowned for his vast learning, was an antiquarian, historian, philologist, student of science, agriculturist, and poet. He was a republican who was reconciled to Julius Caesar and was marked out by him to supervise an intended national library. Of Varro's more than seventy works involving hundreds of volumes we have only his treatise On Agriculture (in Loeb number 283) and part of his monumental achievement De Lingua Latina, On the Latin Language, a work typical of its author's interest not only in antiquarian matters but also in the collection of scientific facts. Originally it consisted of twenty-five books in three parts: etymology of Latin words (books 1-7); their inflexions and other changes (books 8-13); and syntax (books 14-25). Of the whole work survive (somewhat imperfectly) books 5 to 10. These are from the section (books 4-6) which applied etymology to words of time and place and to poetic expressions; the section (books 7-9) on analogy as it occurs in word formation; and the section (books 10-12) which applied analogy to word derivation. Varro's work contains much that is of very great value to the study of the Latin language. The Loeb Classical Library edition of On the Latin Language is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aLatin languagexGrammarxEarly works to 1500. 7aLatin language0(OCoLC)993125.2fast 7aLatin languagexGrammar0(OCoLC)993167.2fast 7aLinguistics0(OCoLC)999202.2fast 7aRoman law0(OCoLC)1099759.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aKent, Roland G.q(Roland Grubb),d1877-1952,etranslator.08iPrint version:aVarro, Marcus Terentius.tOn the Latin language.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1938z9780674993679(v.1)z9780674993686(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v333-334.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL333/1938/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL334/1938/volume.xml03095nam a22004094a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002100228072002300249072002300272072002300295245009900318260005400417300004700471490004000518500002200558505006000580520147400640538003602114546006002150588004702210650002402257650004602281700005002327776013702377830004102514856006502555856006502620hup0000435MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1939    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674993693q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674993990q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198908  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aQA31b.T466 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aMAT0150002bisacsh00aGreek mathematical worksh[electronic resource] /cwith an English translation by Ivor Thomas.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource :bmathematical examples1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v335, 362  aIncludes indexes.0 av.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bBrutus gives an account of the Roman tradition of public and lawcourt speeches from its beginning to what Cicero described as the polished and entertaining speeches of his own day. Along the way Cicero has interesting things to say about the influence of the speaker's audience on his style and technique. Also notable here is an autobiographical sketch. Cicero's own very wide practical experience informs Orator, which depicts the ideal speaker. Here he details the principles of eloquent oratory and quotes instructive examples. Both works date from 46 BCE and are dedicated to the author's promising young friend, Brutus, later famous in the conspiracy against Caesar.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aOratory, Ancient. 0aRhetoricvEarly works to 1800. 0aRhetoric, AncientvSources. 7aIntellectual life0(OCoLC)975769.2fast 7aOratory0(OCoLC)1047214.2fast 7aOratory, Ancient0(OCoLC)1047223.2fast 7aRhetoric0(OCoLC)1096948.2fast 7aRhetoric, Ancient0(OCoLC)1096982.2fast 0aRomexIntellectual lifevSources. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tOrator.1 aHendrickson, G.

Books 16-35 -- v. III. Books 36-48.  aThe epic Dionysiaca by Nonnos of Panopolis in Egypt (fifth century CE) concerns Dionysus' earthly career from birth at Thebes to reception on Olympus. In a poem full of mythology, astrology, and magic, Nonnos relates the god's conquest of the East and also, sensually and explicitly, his amorous adventures.bNonnos of Panopolis in Egypt, who lived in the fifth century of our era, composed the last great epic poem of antiquity. The Dionysiaca, in 48 books, has for its chief theme the expedition of Dionysus against the Indians; but the poet contrives to include all the adventures of the god (as well as much other mythological lore) in a narrative which begins with chaos in heaven and ends with the apotheosis of Ariadne's crown. The wild ecstasy inspired by the god is certainly reflected in the poet's style, which is baroque, extravagant, and unrestrained. It seems that Nonnos was in later years converted to Christianity, for in marked contrast to the Dionysiaca, a poem dealing unreservedly with classical myths and redolent of a pagan outlook, there is extant and ascribed to him a hexameter paraphrase of the Gospel of John. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the Dionysiaca is in three volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aDionysusc(Greek deity)vPoetry. 0aDionysus (Greek deity)vPoetry. 0aEpic poetry, GreekvTranslations into English. 7aDionysus (Greek deity)0(OCoLC)894082.2fast 7aEpic poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)913902.2fast1 aRouse, W.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aFate and fatalism. 0aOratory. 0aRhetoric, Ancient. 0aStoics. 7aFate and fatalism0(OCoLC)921813.2fast 7aLatin literature0(OCoLC)993331.2fast 7aOratory0(OCoLC)1047214.2fast 7aOratory, Ancient0(OCoLC)1047223.2fast 7aRhetoric, Ancient0(OCoLC)1096982.2fast 7aStoics0(OCoLC)1133750.2fast 0aOratory.1 aRackham, H.q(Harris),d1868-1944,etranslator.1 aSutton, E.

Written in prose except for the hexameters on horticulture of Book 10, the work is richly informative about country life in first century CE Italy.bColumella (Lucius Iunius Moderatus) of Gades (Cadiz) lived in the reigns of the first emperors to about 70 CE. He moved early in life to Italy where he owned farms and lived near Rome. It is probable that he did military service in Syria and Cilicia and that he died at Tarentum. Columella's On Agriculture (De Re Rustica) is the most comprehensive, systematic and detailed of Roman agricultural works. Book I covers choice of farming site; water supply; buildings; staff. II: Ploughing; fertilising; care of crops. III, IV, V: Cultivation, grafting and pruning of fruit trees, vines, and olives. VI: Acquisition, breeding, and rearing of oxen, horses, and mules; veterinary medicine. VII: Sheep, goats, pigs, and dogs. VIII: Poultry; fish ponds. IX: Bee-keeping. X (in hexameter poetry): Gardening. XI: Duties of the overseer of a farm; calendar for farm work; more on gardening. XII: Duties of the overseer's wife; manufacture of wines; pickling; preserving. There is also a separate treatise, Trees (De Arboribus), on vines and olives and various trees, perhaps part of an otherwise lost work written before On Agriculture. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Columella is in three volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAgriculturexEarly works to 1800. 7aAgriculture0(OCoLC)801355.2fast1 aAsh, Harrison Boyd,d1891-etranslator.1 aForster, E.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII. Fragments of various works such as dialogues on philosophy and literature; and of treatises on rhetoric, politics and metaphysics.

Books 6-10.  aQuintus Curtius wrote a history of Alexander the Great in the first or second century CE. The first two of ten books have not survived and material is missing from books 5, 6, and 10. Curtius narrates exciting experiences, develops his hero's character, moralizes, and provides one of the five extant works that are evidence for Alexander's career.bQuintus Curtius was apparently a rhetorician who lived in the first century of the Roman empire and, early in the reign of Claudius (41-54 CE), wrote a history of Alexander the Great in 10 books in clear and picturesque style for Latin readers. The first two books have not survived--our narrative begins with events in 333 BCE--and there is material missing from books V, VI, and X. One of his main sources is Cleitarchus who, about 300 BCE, had made Alexander's career a matter of marvellous adventure. Curtius is not a critical historian; and in his desire to entertain and to stress the personality of Alexander, he elaborates effective scenes, omits much that is important for history, and does not worry about chronology. But he does not invent things, except speeches and letters inserted into the narrative by traditional habit. "I copy more than I believe," he says. Three features of his story are narrative of exciting experiences, development of a hero's character, and a disposition to moralise. His history is one of the five extant works on which we rely for the career of Alexander the Great.

Letters of Farmers by Aelian (c. 170-235 CE) portray the country ways of their imagined writers. The Erotic Epistles of Philostratus (perhaps born c. 170 CE) resemble and may have been influenced by those of Alciphron.bThe Letters of Alciphron (second century CE) constitute one of the most attractive products of the Second Sophistic. They are fictitious compositions based on an astonishingly wide variety of circumstances, though the theme of erotic love is constantly sounded. The imagination shown by the author and his convincing realism win him a place of distinction in the early development of romantic prose. The letters, which are highly literary, owing much to the New Comedy of Menander, purport to give us a sketch of the social life of Athens in the fourth century BCE. The collection is arranged in four divisions: Letters of Fishermen; Farmers; Parasites; Courtesans. Senders and addressees are mostly invented characters, but in the last section Alciphron presents us with several attempts at historical fiction, the most engaging being an exchange of letters between Menander and Glycera. This volume also includes twenty Letters of Farmers ascribed to Aelian (c.170-235 CE) and a collection of seventy-three Erotic Epistles of Philostratus (probably Flavius of that name, also born c. 170 CE). In style and subject matter these resemble those of Alciphron, by whom they may have been influenced.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek letters. 7aGreek letters0(OCoLC)947438.2fast0 aAelian,dactive 3rd century,eauthor.0 aPhilostratus,cthe Athenian,dactive 2nd century-3rd century,eauthor.1 aBenner, Allen Rogers,etranslator.1 aFobes, F.

Besides much else, his work conveys the turmoil of his time, and the part he played in a period that saw the rise and fall of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aInvention (Rhetoric) 0aRhetoric, Ancient. 7aInvention (Rhetoric)0(OCoLC)977991.2fast 7aOratory0(OCoLC)1047214.2fast 7aRhetoric0(OCoLC)1096948.2fast 7aRhetoric, Ancient0(OCoLC)1096982.2fast 7aRoman law0(OCoLC)1099759.2fast 7aTopic (Philosophy)0(OCoLC)1152656.2fast12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tDe optimo genere oratorum.12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tTopica.1 aHubbell, H.

His works include the Psychomachia, an allegorical description of the struggle between (Christian) virtues and (pagan) vices; lyric poetry; and--a valuable source on Christian iconography--poetic inscriptions for biblical scenes on the walls of a church.bPrudentius (Aurelius Prudentius Clemens) was born in 348 CE probably at Caesaraugusta (Saragossa) and lived mostly in northeastern Spain, but visited Rome between 400 and 405. His parents, presumably Christian, had him educated in literature and rhetoric. He became a barrister and at least once later on an administrator; he afterwards received some high honour from Emperor Theodosius. Prudentius was a strong Christian who admired the old pagan literature and art, especially the great Latin poets whose forms he used. He looked on the Roman achievement in history as a preparation for the coming of Christ and the triumph of a spiritual empire. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the poems of Prudentius is in two volumes. Volume I presents: Preface (Praefatio); The Daily Round (Liber Cathemerinon); 12 literary and attractive hymns, parts of which have been included in the Breviary and in modern hymnals; The Divinity of Christ (Apotheosis), which maintains the Trinity and attacks those who denied the distinct personal being of Christ; The Origin of Sin (Hamartigenia) attacking the separation of the "strict" God of the Old Testament from the "good" God revealed by Christ; Fight for Mansoul (Psychomachia), which describes the struggle between (Christian) Virtues and (Pagan) Vices; and the first book of Against the Address of Symmachus (Contra Orationem Symmachi), in which pagan gods are assailed. The second volume contains the second book of Against the Address of Symmachus, opposing a petition for the replacement of an altar and statue of Victory; Crowns of Martyrdom (Peristephanon Liber), 14 hymns to martyrs mostly of Spain; Lines To Be Inscribed under Scenes from History (Tituli Historiarum), 49 four-line stanzas which are inscriptions for scenes from the Bible depicted on the walls of a church; and an Epilogue.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aPrudentius,d348-xTranslations into English. 0aChristian poetry, LatinxTranslations into English. 0aHymns, LatinxTranslations into English. 7aChristian poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)859448.2fast 7aHymns, Latin0(OCoLC)965595.2fast1 aThomson, H.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bAristotle, great Greek philosopher, researcher, reasoner, and writer, born at Stagirus in 384 BCE, was the son of Nicomachus, a physician, and Phaestis. He studied under Plato at Athens and taught there (367-47); subsequently he spent three years at the court of a former pupil, Hermeias, in Asia Minor and at this time married Pythias, one of Hermeias's relations. After some time at Mitylene, in 343-2 he was appointed by King Philip of Macedon to be tutor of his teen-aged son Alexander. After Philip's death in 336, Aristotle became head of his own school (of "Peripatetics"), the Lyceum at Athens. Because of anti-Macedonian feeling there after Alexander's death in 323, he withdrew to Chalcis in Euboea, where he died in 322. Nearly all the works Aristotle prepared for publication are lost; the priceless ones extant are lecture-materials, notes, and memoranda (some are spurious). They can be categorized as follows:I. Practical: Nicomachean Ethics; Great Ethics (Magna Moralia); Eudemian Ethics; Politics; Oeconomica (on the good of the family); Virtues and Vices. II. Logical: Categories; On Interpretation; Analytics (Prior and Posterior); On Sophistical Refutations; Topica. III. Physical: Twenty-six works (some suspect) including astronomy, generation and destruction, the senses, memory, sleep, dreams, life, facts about animals, etc. IV. Metaphysics: on being as being. V. On Art: Art of Rhetoric and Poetics. VI. Other works including the Athenian Constitution; more works also of doubtful authorship. VII.

But most recent editors attribute it to an unknown author.bCicero (Marcus Tullius, 106-43 BCE), Roman lawyer, orator, politician and philosopher, of whom we know more than of any other Roman, lived through the stirring era which saw the rise, dictatorship, and death of Julius Caesar in a tottering republic. In his political speeches especially and in his correspondence we see the excitement, tension and intrigue of politics and the part he played in the turmoil of the time. Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments. Philosophical works include seven extant major compositions and a number of others; and some lost. There is also poetry, some original, some as translations from the Greek.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 7aOratory, Ancient0(OCoLC)1047223.2fast 7aRhetoric, Ancient0(OCoLC)1096982.2fast1 aCaplan, Harry,d1896-1980,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCicero, Marcus Tullius.tRhetorica ad herennium.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1954z9780674994447 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v403.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL403/1954/volume.xml04999nam a22006494a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177020004100218020004100259020004100300020004100341035002100382040001200403041001800415050002300433072002300456072002300479100004900502240003800551245005300589260005400642300002200696490003900718504003700757505054000794520161401334538003602948546006002984588004703044650003803091650004103129650002003170650003803190650005303228650004103281700006203322700005203384700003303436700005103469700004003520700003403560776026003594830004003854856006503894856006503959856006504024856006504089856006504154856006504219856006504284hup0000511MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1957    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674994522q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990302q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674994553q(v. 3)qprint version  z9780674994560q(v. 4)qprint version  z9780674994577q(v. 5)qprint version  z9780674994584q(v. 6)qprint version  z9780674994591q(v. 7)qprint version  a(OCoLC)903198903  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6156b.A948 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPHI0020002bisacsh0 aAugustine,cSaint, Bishop of Hippo,eauthor.10aDe civitate Dei.lEnglish & Latin10aCity of Godh[electronic resource] /cAugustine.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v411-417  aIncludes bibliography and index.0 av.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius and the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of all sensual habits and to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Christianity. He returned to Tagaste and there founded a religious community. In 395 or 396 he became Bishop of Hippo, and was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing and controversy. He died at Hippo during the successful siege by the Vandals. From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers that great autobiography the Confessions (in two volumes); On the City of God (seven volumes), which unfolds God's action in the progress of the world's history, and propounds the superiority of Christian beliefs over pagan in adversity; and a selection of Letters which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history and Augustine's relations with other theologians.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aApologeticsvEarly works to 1800. 0aKingdom of GodvEarly works to 1800. 0aKingdom of God. 7aApologetics0(OCoLC)811449.2fast 7aApologeticsxEarly church0(OCoLC)1906759.2fast 7aKingdom of God0(OCoLC)987680.2fast1 aGreen, William M.q(William McAllen),d1897-etranslator.1 aGreene, William Chase,d1890-1978,etranslator.1 aLevine, Philip,etranslator.1 aMcCracken, George Englert,d1904-etranslator.1 aSanford, Eva Matthews,etranslator.1 aWiesen, David S.etranslator.08iPrint version:aAugustine, Saint, Bishop of Hippo.tCity of God.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1957z9780674994522(v.1)z9780674990302(v.2)z9780674994553(v.3)z9780674994560(v.4)z9780674994577(v.5)z9780674994584(v.6)z9780674994591(v.7) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v411-417.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL411/1957/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL412/1963/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL413/1968/volume.xml403v.4uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL414/1966/volume.xml403v.5uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL415/1965/volume.xml403v.6uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL416/1960/volume.xml403v.7uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL417/1972/volume.xml04024nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002500179072002300204072002300227100002600250245021500276260005400491300002200545490003500567500002200602520199000624538003602614546006002650588004702710650004502757650001802802650003902820650005202859650004902911650005202960700003403012700005503046700005503101700009003156700004203246700005103288776010703339830003603446856006003482hup0000521MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1973    mau    go     00| p eng d  z9780674994638qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735945  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3622.A2bC355 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aPOE0080002bisacsh0 aCallimachus,eauthor.10aAetiah[electronic resource] ; bIambi ; Hecale and other fragments /cCallimachus ; edited and translated by C.

Hero and Leander by Musaeus (fifth or sixth century CE) is a short epic poem.bCallimachus of Cyrene, born ca. 310 BCE, after studying philosophy at Athens, became a teacher of grammar and poetry at Alexandria. Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt (reigned 285-247) made him when still young a librarian in the new library at Alexandria; he prepared a great catalogue of its books. Callimachus was author of much poetry and many works in prose, but not much survives. His hymns and epigrams are given with works by Aratus and Lycophron in another volume (no. 129) of the Loeb Classical Library. In the present volume are included fragments of the Aetia (Causes), aetiological legends concerning Greek history and customs; fragments of a book of Iambi; 147 fragments of the epic poem Hecale, which described Theseus's victory over the bull which infested Marathon; and other fragments. We have no explicit information about the poet Musaeus, author of the short epic poem on Hero and Leander, except that he is given in some manuscripts the title Grammatikos, a teacher learned in the rhetoric, poetry and philosophy of his time. He was obviously a follower of the Egyptian poet Nonnus of Panopolis, of the fifth century AD, and his poem seems also to presuppose the Paraphrase of the Psalms of Pseudo-Apollinarius which can be dated to the period 460-470. Musaeus takes up a subject whose first detailed treatment is preserved in Ovid's Heroides (Epistles 18 and 19), but he presents it in a quite different manner. Among the literary antecedents to which this learned grammatikos expressly alludes, the most prominent are Books 5 and 6 of the Odyssey and Plato's Phaedrus. He draws too on the Hymns of Proclus and the Metaphrasis of the Gospel of St. John by Nonnus. He was most probably a Christian Neoplatonist writing a Christian allegory.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek poetryxTranslations into English. 0aGreek poetry. 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 7aGreek poetry, Hellenistic0(OCoLC)947510.2fast 7aHero (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)955551.2fast 7aLeander (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)994788.2fast02aCallimachus,eauthor.tIambi.02aCallimachus,eauthor.tHecale and other fragments.02aMusaeus,cGrammaticus,eauthor.tHero and Leander.1 aTrypanis, Constantine A.q(Constantine Athanasius),d1909-1993,eeditor,etranslator.1 aGelzer, Thomas,eeditor,etranslator.1 aWhitman, Cedric Hubbell,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aCallimachus.tAetia.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1973z9780674994638 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v421.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL421/1973/volume.xml02250nam a22003854a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225072002300248100004300271245009700314260005400411300002200465490003500487500002000522520083300542538003601375546006001411588004701471650003601518650003601554700004901590776012901639830003601768856006001804hup0000535MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1940    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674994799qprint version  a(OCoLC)606421981  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.P765 2014 7aHIS0020002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aSCI0340002bisacsh0 aPtolemy,dactive 2nd century,eauthor.10aTetrabiblosh[electronic resource] /cPtolemy ; with an English translation by F.E.

From the same period come the lively fables in Latin verse written by Phaedrus, which satirize social and political life in Augustan Rome.bBabrius is the reputed author of a collection (discovered in the 19th century) of more than 125 fables based on those called Aesop's, in Greek verse. He may have been a hellenised Roman living in Asia Minor during the late 1st century of our era. The fables are all in one metre and in very good style, humorous and pointed. Some are original. Phaedrus, born in Macedonia, flourished in the early half of the 1st century of our era. Apparently a slave set free by the emperor Augustus, he lived in Italy and began to write Aesopian fables. When he offended Sejanus, a powerful official of the emperor Tiberius, he was punished but not silenced. The fables, in five books, are in lively terse and simple Latin verse not lacking in dignity. They not only amuse and teach but also satirise social and political life in Rome. This edition includes a comprehensive analytical Survey of Greek and Latin fables in the Aesopic tradition, as well as a historical introduction.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aAesopxInfluence.00aAesop's fablesxParodies, imitations, etc. 0aClassical poetryxTranslations into English. 0aClassical poetry. 0aFables, ClassicalxStories, plots, etc. 0aFables, ClassicalxTranslations into English. 0aFables, Classical. 7aClassical poetry0(OCoLC)863547.2fast 7aFables, Classical0(OCoLC)919395.2fast 7aInfluence (Literary, artistic, etc.)0(OCoLC)972484.2fast0 aPhaedrus,eauthor.1 aPerry, B.

They can be categorized as practical; logical; physical; metaphysical; on art; other; fragments.bIn History of Animals, Aristotle analyzes "differences"--in parts, activities, modes of life, and character--across the animal kingdom, in preparation for establishing their causes, which are the concern of his other zoological works. Over 500 species of animals are considered: shellfish, insects, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals--including human beings. In Books I-IV, Aristotle gives a comparative survey of internal and external body parts, including tissues and fluids, and of sense faculties and voice. Books V-VI study reproductive methods, breeding habits, and embryogenesis as well as some secondary sex differences. In Books VII-IX, Aristotle examines differences among animals in feeding; in habitat, hibernation, migration; in enmities and sociability; in disposition (including differences related to gender) and intelligence. Here too he describes the human reproductive system, conception, pregnancy, and obstetrics. Book X establishes the female's contribution to generation. The Loeb Classical Library edition of History of Animals is in three volumes.

His writings were edited by his disciple Porphyry, who published them many years after his master's death in six sets of nine treatises each (the Enneads). Plotinus regarded Plato as his master, and his own philosophy is a profoundly original development of the Platonism of the first two centuries of the Christian era and the closely related thought of the Neopythagoreans, with some influences from Aristotle and his followers and the Stoics, whose writings he knew well but used critically. He is a unique combination of mystic and Hellenic rationalist. His thought dominated later Greek philosophy and influenced both Christians and Moslems, and is still alive today because of its union of rationality and intense religious experience. In his acclaimed edition of Plotinus, Armstrong provides excellent introductions to each treatise. His invaluable notes explain obscure passages and give reference to parallels in Plotinus and others.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aPlato.00aPlotinusxCriticism and interpretation.00aPlotinusxDisciples.00aPlotinus.tEnneads.nII, 9 (33) 7aIntellect0(OCoLC)975732.2fast 7aNeoplatonism0(OCoLC)1035884.2fast 7aOne (The One in philosophy)0(OCoLC)1045763.2fast 7aPhilosophy0(OCoLC)1060777.2fast 7aSelf (Philosophy)0(OCoLC)1111454.2fast 7aSoul0(OCoLC)1432098.2fast1 aArmstrong, A.

AD 170 at Praeneste, was a pupil of the rhetorician Pausanias of Caesarea, and taught and practised rhetoric. Expert in Attic Greek, he became a serious scholar and studied history under the patronage of the Roman empress Julia Domna. He apparently spent all his life in Italy where he died after AD 230. Aelian's On the Characteristics of Animals, in 17 books, is a collection of facts and beliefs concerning the habits of animals drawn from Greek authors and some personal observation. Fact, fancy, legend, stories and gossip all play their part in a narrative which is meant to entertain readers. If there is any ethical motive, it is that the virtues of untaught yet reasoning animals can be a lesson to thoughtless and selfish mankind. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the work is in three volumes. The Historical Miscellany (Loeb no. 486) is of similar nature. In 14 books, it consists mainly of historical and biographical anecdotes and retellings of legendary events. Some of Aelian's material is drawn from authors whose works are lost. Aelian's Letters--portraying the affairs and country ways of a series of fictitious writers-offer engaging vignettes of rural life. These are available in Loeb no. 383.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aZoologyvPre-Linnean works. 7aAnimals0(OCoLC)809468.2fast 7aZoology0(OCoLC)1184696.2fast1 aScholfield, A.

Seneca's method is to survey the theories of major authorities on the subject at hand, so his work is a guide to Greek and Roman thinking about the heavens.bSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, born at Corduba (Cordova) ca. 4 BCE, of a prominent and wealthy family, spent an ailing childhood and youth at Rome in an aunt's care. He became famous in rhetoric, philosophy, money-making, and imperial service. After some disgrace during Claudius' reign he became tutor and then, in 54 CE, advising minister to Nero, some of whose worst misdeeds he did not prevent. Involved (innocently?) in a conspiracy, he killed himself by order in 65. Wealthy, he preached indifference to wealth; evader of pain and death, he preached scorn of both; and there were other contrasts between practice and principle. We have Seneca's philosophical or moral essays (ten of them traditionally called Dialogues)--on providence, steadfastness, the happy life, anger, leisure, tranquility, the brevity of life, gift-giving, forgiveness--and treatises on natural phenomena. Also extant are 124 epistles, in which he writes in a relaxed style about moral and ethical questions, relating them to personal experiences; a skit on the official deification of Claudius, Apocolocyntosis (in Loeb number 15); and nine rhetorical tragedies on ancient Greek themes. Many epistles and all his speeches are lost. The 124 epistles are collected in Volumes IV-VI of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca. The treatises on natural phenomena, Naturales Quaestiones, are collected in Volumes VII and X of the Loeb Classical Library's ten-volume edition of Seneca.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMeteorologyxEarly works to 1800. 0aScience, Ancient. 7aScience0(OCoLC)1108176.2fast1 aCorcoran, Thomas H.etranslator.08iPrint version:aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, approximately 4 B.C.-65 A.D.tNatural questions.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1971z9780674994959(v.1)z9780674992801(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v450, 457.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL450/1971/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL457/1972/volume.xml03611nam a22004694a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274072002300297100002300320245009700343260005400440300002200494490003900516504003900555505007600594520166700670538003602337546006002373588004702433600004102480650003202521650006502553650003802618650005502656650006002711700005902771776014102830830004002971856006503011856006503076hup0000551MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1969    mau    gob    00| s eng d  z9780674994966q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674995284q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)647004332  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.L533 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aLibanius,eauthor.10aSelected orationsh[electronic resource] /cLibanius ; edited and translated by A.F.

His works include Orations, the first of which is an autobiography, and Letters.bLibanius (314-393 CE) was one of the last great publicists and teachers of Greek paganism. His story, as presented in his Autobiography and the Life by Eunapius, is supplemented by information from a correspondence of over 1500 items and 64 extant orations. A native of Antioch, he began his teaching career in Constantinople in 340, but soon had to retire to Nicomedeia, where he became acquainted with St. Basil and influential in the development of Julian's paganism. After a second tenure at Constantinople he returned home to become professor in Antioch in 354, a position which he held, through many vicissitudes, for the rest of his life. As sophist of Antioch and a devoted exponent of the traditional Hellenic system of education, Libanius remained deliberately and contemptuously unacquainted with Latin, and deplored its growing influence. Naturally humane in outlook and sympathizing with the local bourgeoisie, he criticized bitterly the encroachments and oppressions of the central administration, and the general cruelty of his day. Sincerely pagan in an increasingly aggressive Christian society, he became an influential voice against religious persecution, official or unofficial. The orations on Julian, to whose memory he remained devoted all his life, were composed between 362 and 365, and present Libanius with a congenial subject, revealing him at the height of his powers and influence.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aLibaniusxTranslations into English. 0aSophists (Greek philosophy) 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., GreekxTranslations into English. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Greek. 7aSophists (Greek philosophy)0(OCoLC)1126720.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Greek0(OCoLC)1129363.2fast1 aNorman, A.

In these years, a succession of frontier crises and a disastrous lack of economic planning established a pattern of military coups and increasing cultural pluralism. Of this revolutionary epoch we know all too little. The selection of chance has destroyed all but a handful of the literary sources that deal with the immediate post- Antonine scene. Herodian's work is one of the few that have survived, and it has come down to us completely intact. Of the author we know virtually nothing, except that he served in some official capacity in the empire of which he wrote. His History was apparently produced for the benefit of people in the Greek-speaking half of the Roman empire. It betrays the faults of an age when truth was distorted by rhetoric and stereotypes were a substitute for sound reason. But it is an essential document for any who would try to understand the nature of the Roman empire in an era of rapidly changing social and political institutions. The Loeb Classical Library edition of Herodian is in two volumes.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aRomexHistoryyEmpire, 30 B.C.-284 A.D. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aWhittaker, C.

Two invective speeches linked with Cicero are probably anonymous exercises. The Letter to Octavian likely dates from the third or fourth century CE. The Handbook of Electioneering was said to be written by Quintus to Cicero.bCicero's letters to his brother, Quintus, allow us an intimate glimpse of their world. Vividly informative too is Cicero's correspondence with Brutus dating from the spring of 43 BCE, which conveys the drama of the period following the assassination of Julius Caesar. These are now made available in a new Loeb Classical Library edition. Shackleton Bailey also provides in this volume a new text and translation of two invective speeches purportedly delivered in the Senate; these are probably anonymous ancient schoolbook exercises but have long been linked with the works of Sallust and Cicero. The Letter to Octavian, ostensibly by Cicero but probably dating from the third or fourth century CE, is included as well. Here too is the Handbook of Electioneering, a guide said to be written by Quintus to his brother, an interesting treatise on Roman elections.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.10aCicero, Marcus TulliusvCorrespondence. 7aAuthors, Latin0(OCoLC)822194.2fast 7aPolitical campaigns0(OCoLC)1069212.2fast 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Latin0(OCoLC)1129386.2fast 7aStatesmen0(OCoLC)1131990.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tLetter fragments.12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tLetter to Octavian.12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tInvectives.12aCicero, Marcus Tullius,eauthor.tHandbook of electioneering.1 aShackleton Bailey, D.

Extracts from famous declaimers of Seneca's illuminate influences on the styles of most pagan (and many Christian) writers of the Empire.bRoman secondary education aimed principally at training future lawyers and politicians. Under the late Republic and the Empire, the main instrument was an import from Greece: declamation, the making of practice speeches on imaginary subjects. There were two types of such speeches: controversiae on law-court themes, suasoriae on deliberative topics. On both types a prime source of our knowledge is the work of Lucius Annaeus Seneca, a Spaniard from Cordoba, father of the distinguished philosopher. Towards the end of his long life (?55 BCE-?40 CE) he collected together ten books devoted to controversiae (some only preserved in excerpt) and at least one (surviving) of suasoriae. These books contained his memories of the famous rhetorical teachers and practitioners of his day: their lines of argument, their methods of approach, their idiosyncrasies, and above all their epigrams. The extracts from the declaimers, though scrappy, throw invaluable light on the influences that coloured the styles of most pagan (and many Christian) writers of the Empire. Unity is provided by Seneca's own contribution, the lively prefaces, engaging anecdote about speakers, writers and politicians, and brisk criticism of declamatory excess.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aSpeeches, addresses, etc., LatinvTranslations into English. 7aSpeeches, addresses, etc., Latin0(OCoLC)1129386.2fast 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aWinterbottom, Michael,d1934-etranslator.08iPrint version:aSeneca, Lucius Annaeus, approximately 55 B.C.-approximately 39 A.D.tDeclamations.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1974z9780674995109(v.1)z9780674995116(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v463-464.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL463/1974/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL464/1974/volume.xml03718nam a22004574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274072002300297100004300320245012100363260005400484300002200538490003900560504003700599505015700636520174600793538003602539546006002575588004702635650002202682650006102704650004302765650004902808650003502857700004002892776015802932830004003090856006503130856006503195hup0000565MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1974    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674995123q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674993822q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)558208470  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.D566 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aDionysius,cof Halicarnassus,eauthor.10aCritical essaysh[electronic resource] /cDionysius of Halicarnassus ; with an English translation by Stephen Usher.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v465-466  aIncludes bibliography and index.0 av.

They constitute an important development from the somewhat mechanical techniques of rhetorical handbooks to more sensitive criticism of individual authors.bDionysius of Halicarnassus had migrated to Rome by 30 BCE, where he lived until his death some time after 8 BCE, writing his Roman Antiquities and teaching the art of rhetoric and literary composition. Dionysius's purpose, both in his own work and in his teaching, was to re-establish the classical Attic standards of purity, invention and taste in order to reassert the primacy of Greek as the literary language of the Mediterranean world. He advocated the minute study of the styles of the finest prose authors of the fifth and fourth century BCE, especially the Attic orators. His critical essays on these and on the historian Thucydides represent an important development from the somewhat mechanical techniques of rhetorical handbooks to a more sensitive criticism of individual authors. Illustrating his analysis with well-chosen examples, Dionysius preserves a number of important fragments of Lysias and Isaeus. The essays on those two orators and on Isocrates, Demosthenes and Thucydides comprise Volume I of this edition. Volume II contains three letters to his students; a short essay on the orator Dinarchus; and his finest work, the essay On Literary Composition, which combines rhetoric, grammar and criticism in a manner unique in ancient literature. The Loeb Classical Library also publishes a seven volume edition of Roman Antiquities, by Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a history from earliest times to 264 BCE.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek literature. 7aClassical literaturexAppreciation0(OCoLC)863510.2fast 7aGreek literature0(OCoLC)947441.2fast 7aGreek prose literature0(OCoLC)947525.2fast 7aPoetics0(OCoLC)1067682.2fast1 aUsher, Stephen,d1931-etranslator.08iPrint version:aDionysius, of Halicarnassus.tCritical essays.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1974z9780674995123(v.1)z9780674993822(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v465-466.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL465/1974/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL466/1985/volume.xml02809nam a22004574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225100003100248245012700279260005400406300002200460490003500482500006800517500002000585520099600605538003601601546006001637588004701697650004701744650004601791650003501837650003701872650003701909651003401946651004101980700004702021700004802068776013902116830003602255856006002291hup0000567MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1929    mau    go     00| 0beng d  z9780674995147qprint version  a(OCoLC)692541943  aMaCbHUP1 aengalathlat00aPA6515b.C676 2014 7aHIS0020202bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh1 aNepos, Cornelius,eauthor.10aOn great generalsh[electronic resource] ; bOn historians /cCornelius Nepos ; with an English translation by J.C.

He also gives witty character sketches of persons born under particular constellations.bMarcus Manilius, who lived in the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, is the author of the earliest treatise on astrology we possess. His Astronomica, a Latin didactic poem in five books, begins with an account of celestial phenomena, and then proceeds to treat of the signs of the zodiac and the twelve temples; there follow instructions for calculating the horoscoping degree, and details of chronocrators, decans, injurious degrees, zodiacal geography, paranatellonta, and other technical matters. Besides exhibiting great virtuosity in rendering mathematical tables and diagrams in verse form, the poet writes with some passion about his Stoic beliefs and shows much wit and humour in his character sketches of persons born under particular stars. Perhaps taking a lead from Virgil in his Georgics, Manilius abandons the proportions of his last book to narrate the story of Perseus and Andromeda at considerable length. In spite of its undoubted elegance, the Astronomica is a difficult work, and this edition provides in addition to the first English prose translation a full guide to the poem, with copious explanatory notes and illustrative figures.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aAstrologyvEarly works to 1800. 0aAstrologyvPoetry. 0aAstronomyvEarly works to 1800. 0aAstronomy, AncientvPoetry. 7aAstrology0(OCoLC)819398.2fast 7aAstronomy0(OCoLC)819673.2fast 7aAstronomy, Ancient0(OCoLC)819761.2fast 7aDidactic poetry, Latin0(OCoLC)893018.2fast1 aGoold, George Patrick,d1922-2001,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aManilius, Marcus.tAstronomica.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1977z9780674995161 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v469.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL469/1977/volume.xml03524nam a22004454a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177035002100218040001200239041001800251050002100269072002300290072002300313100002700336245013000363260005400493300002200547490004400569505006200613520162200675538003602297546006002333588004702393650003102440650003302471650003402504700005802538700007502596776016702671830004502838856006502883856006502948856006503013hup0000571MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s1976    mau    go     00| 0 eng d  z9780674995192q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674990883q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674995246q(v. 3)qprint version  a(OCoLC)646847608  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aQK41b.T446 2014 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aTheophrastus,eauthor.10aDe Causis Plantarumh[electronic resource] /cTheophrastus ; edited and translated by Benedict Einarson and George K.K.

In the latter Theophrastus turns to plant physiology.bTheophrastus of Eresus in Lesbos, born about 370 BCE, is the author of the most important botanical works that have survived from classical antiquity. He was in turn student, collaborator, and successor of Aristotle. Like his predecessor he was interested in all aspects of human knowledge and experience, especially natural science. His writings on plants form a counterpart to Aristotle's zoological works. In the Enquiry into Plants Theophrastus classifies and describes varieties--covering trees, plants of particular regions, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and cereals; in the last of the nine books he focuses on plant juices and medicinal properties of herbs. The Loeb Classical Library edition is in two volumes; the second contains two additional treatises: On Odours and Weather Signs. In De Causis Plantarum Theophrastus turns to plant physiology. Books One and Two are concerned with generation, sprouting, flowering and fruiting, and the effects of climate. In Books Three and Four Theophrastus studies cultivation and agricultural methods. In Books Five and Six he discusses plant breeding; diseases and other causes of death; and distinctive flavours and odours. Theophrastus's celebrated Characters is of a quite different nature. This collection of descriptive sketches is the earliest known character-writing and a striking reflection of contemporary life.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aBotanyvPre-Linnean works. 7aBotany0(OCoLC)836869.2fast 7aPlants0(OCoLC)1065823.2fast1 aEinarson, Benedict,d1906-1978,eeditor,etranslator.1 aLink, George K.

His works include Orations, the first of which is an autobiography, and Letters.bA professing pagan in an aggressively Christian empire, a friend of the emperor Julian and acquaintance of St. Basil, a potent spokesman for private and political causes--Libanius can tell us much about the tumultuous world of the fourth century. Born in Antioch to a wealthy family steeped in the culture and religious traditions of Hellenism, Libanius rose to fame as a teacher of the classics in a period of rapid social change. In his lifetime Libanius was an acknowledged master of the art of letter writing. Today his letters--about 1550 of which survive--offer an enthralling self-portrait of this combative pagan publicist and a vivid picture of the culture and political intrigues of the eastern empire. A. F. Norman selects one eighth of the extant letters, which come from two periods in Libanius's life, 355-365 and 388-393 CE, letters written to Julian, churchmen, civil officials, scholars, and his many influential friends. The Letters are complemented, in this two-volume edition, by Libanius's Autobiography (Oration 1), a revealing narrative that begins as a scholar's account and ends as an old man's private journal. Also available in the Loeb Classical Library is a two-volume edition of Libanius's Orations.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aLibaniusxTranslations into English. 0aOratorszTurkeyzAntiochvBiography. 0aOratorszTurkeyzAntiochxCorrespondence. 0aSophists (Greek philosophy)vBiography. 0aSophists (Greek philosophy)xCorrespondence. 7aOrators0(OCoLC)1047212.2fast 7aSophists (Greek philosophy)0(OCoLC)1126720.2fast 7aTurkeyzAntioch0(OCoLC)1216199.2fast1 aNorman, A.

It is a fast-paced historical romance with ageless charm. Chariton narrates the adventures of an exceptionally beautiful young bride named Callirhoe, beginning with her abduction by pirates--adventures that take her as far as the court of the Persian king Artaxerxes and involve shipwrecks, several ardent suitors, an embarrassing pregnancy, the hazards of war, and a happy ending. Animated dialogue captures dramatic situations, and the novelist takes us on picturesque travels. His skill makes us enthralled spectators of plots and counterplots, at trials and a crucifixion, inside a harem, among the admiring crowd at weddings, and at battles on land and sea. This enchanting tale is here made available for the first time in an English translation facing the Greek text. In his Introduction G. P.

Eighteen of his ninety or so plays survive complete, including Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae, one of the great masterpieces of the tragic genre. Fragments of his lost plays also survive.bOne of Athens' greatest poets, Euripides has been prized in every age for the pathos, terror, surprising plot twists, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations. Here are four of his plays in a new Loeb Classical Library edition. Hippolytus triumphed in the Athenian dramatic competition of 428 BCE; in modern times it has been judged to be one of Euripides' masterpieces. It tells of the punishment that the goddess Aphrodite inflicts on a young man who refuses to worship her. Hecuba and Andromache recreate the tragic stories of two noble Trojan women after their city's fall. Children of Heracles, probably first produced in 430, soon after the Spartan invasion of Attica, celebrates an incident long a source of Athenian pride: the city's protection of the sons and daughters of the dead Heracles. In this second volume of the new Loeb Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text facing an accurate and graceful prose translation.

He wrote at least forty plays, of which eleven have survived complete. In this new Loeb Classical Library edition of Aristophanes, Jeffrey Henderson presents a freshly edited Greek text and a lively, unexpurgated translation with full explanatory notes. Three plays are in Volume II of the new edition. Socrates' "Thinkery" is at the center of Clouds, which spoofs untraditional techniques for educating young men. Wasps satirizes Athenian enthusiasm for jury service and the law courts as well as the city's susceptibility to demagogues.

The collection was very popular in the Renaissance and has recently attracted renewed scholarly attention. Yet to date there has been no modern English translation of Memorable Doings and Sayings. This work is now added to the Loeb Classical Library, a freshly edited Latin text facing D. R. Shackleton Bailey's pleasing and authoritative translation. Valerius arranges his instructive examples in short chapters, each focused on a particular virtue, vice, religious practice, or traditional custom--including Omens, Dreams, Anger, Cruelty, Bravery, Fidelity, Gratitude, Friendship, Parental Love. The moral undercurrent of this collection is readily apparent. But Valerius tells us that the book's purpose is practical: he decided to select worthwhile material from famous writers so that people looking for illustrative examples might be spared the trouble of research. Whatever the author's intention, his book is an interesting source of information on Roman attitudes toward religion and moral values in the first century.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aValerius MaximusvTranslations into English. 0aAnecdotesvEarly works to 1800. 0aDidactic literature, LatinxTranslations into English. 7aAnecdotes0(OCoLC)808608.2fast 7aCivilization0(OCoLC)862898.2fast 7aDidactic literature, Latin0(OCoLC)892967.2fast 7aManners and customs0(OCoLC)1007815.2fast 0aRomexCivilizationvAnecdotes. 0aRomexSocial life and customsvAnecdotes. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast1 aShackleton Bailey, D.

Eighteen of his ninety or so plays survive complete, including Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae, one of the great masterpieces of the tragic genre. Fragments of his lost plays also survive.bOne of antiquity's greatest poets, Euripides has been prized in every age for the pathos, terror, and intellectual probing of his dramatic creations. This volume completes the new six-volume Loeb Classical Library edition of his plays. In Bacchae, a masterpiece of tragic drama, Euripides tells the story of king Pentheus's resistance to the worship of Dionysus and his horrific punishment. Iphigenia at Aulis recounts the sacrifice of Agamemnon's daughter to Artemis, the price exacted by the goddess for favorable sailing winds. Rhesus (probably not by Euripides) dramatizes a pivotal incident in the Trojan War. David Kovacs presents a faithful and skillfully worded translation of the three plays, facing a freshly edited Greek text.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aDionysusc(Greek deity)vDrama.00aEuripidesvTranslations into English.00aIphigeniac(Mythological character)vDrama.00aPentheus,cKing of Thebes (Mythological character)vDrama.00aRhesus,cKing of Thrace (Legendary character)vDrama. 0aBacchantesvDrama. 0aIphigenia (Greek mythology)vDrama. 0aPentheus (Greek mythology)vDrama. 0aRhesus (Legendary character)vDrama. 0aTrojan WarvDrama. 7aGreek drama (Satyr play)0(OCoLC)947144.2fast 7aGreek drama (Tragedy)0(OCoLC)947146.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aMythology, Greek, in literature0(OCoLC)1031814.2fast 7aTragedy0(OCoLC)1154355.2fast02aEuripides,eauthor.tIphigenia at Aulis.02aEuripides,eauthor.tRhesus.1 aKovacs, David,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aEuripides.tBacchae.

Comic poems in the Homeric Apocrypha include the Battle of Frogs and Mice (probably not earlier than first century CE). Lives of Homer include a version of The Contest of Homer and Hesiod that dates from the second century BCE.bPerformances of Greek epics customarily began with a hymn to a god or goddess--as Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days do. A collection of thirty-three such poems has come down to us from antiquity under the title "Hymns of Homer." This new Loeb Classical Library volume contains, in addition to the Hymns, fragments of five comic poems that were connected with Homer's name in or just after the Classical period (but are not today believed to be by the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey). Here too is a collection of ancient accounts of the poet's life. The Hymns range widely in length: two are over 500 lines long; several run only a half dozen lines. Among the longest are the hymn To Demeter, which tells the foundational story of the Eleusinian Mysteries; and To Hermes, distinctive in being amusing. The comic poems gathered as Homeric Apocrypha include Margites, the Battle of Frogs and Mice, and, for the first time in English, a fragment of a perhaps earlier poem of the same type called Battle of the Weasel and the Mice. The edition of Lives of Homer contains The Contest of Homer and Hesiod and nine other biographical accounts, translated into English for the first time. Martin West's faithful and pleasing translations are fully annotated; his freshly edited texts offer new solutions to a number of textual puzzles.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aHomerxAuthorship.00aHomer.00aHomeric hymnsvTranslations into English. 0aGreek poetryvTranslations into English. 0aHymns, Greek (Classical)xTranslations into English. 0aPoets, GreekvBiography. 7aAuthorship0(OCoLC)822442.2fast 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 7aHymns, Greek (Classical)0(OCoLC)965569.2fast 7aPoets, Greek0(OCoLC)1067912.2fast1 aWest, M.

Genealogical epic of that archaic era includes poems that create prehistories for Corinth and Samos. These works are an important source of mythological record.bGreek epics of the archaic period include poems that narrate a particular heroic episode or series of episodes and poems that recount the long-term history of families or peoples. They are an important source of mythological record. Here is a new text and translation of the examples of this poetry that have come down to us. The heroic epic is represented by poems about Heracles and Theseus, and by two great epic cycles: the Theban Cycle, which tells of the failed assault on Thebes by the Seven and the subsequent successful assault by their sons; and the Trojan Cycle, which includes Cypria, Little Iliad, and The Sack of Ilion. Among the genealogical epics are poems in which Eumelus creates a prehistory for Corinth and Asius creates one for Samos. In presenting the extant fragments of these early epic poems, Martin West provides very helpful notes.

Comments and suggestions the instructor adds to his model speeches for fictitious court cases offer insight into Roman law and education.bThe Lesser Declamations, dating perhaps from the second century CE and attributed to Quintilian, might more accurately be described as emanating from "the school of Quintilian." The collection--here made available for the first time in translation--represents classroom materials for budding Roman lawyers. The instructor who composed these specimen speeches for fictitious court cases adds his comments and suggestions concerning presentation and arguing tactics--thereby giving us insight into Roman law and education. A wide range of scenarios is imagined. Some evoke the plots of ancient novels and comedies: pirates, exiles, parents and children in conflict, adulterers, rapists, and wicked stepmothers abound. Other cases deal with such matters as warfare between neighboring cities, smuggling, historical (and quasi-historical) events, tyrants and tyrannicides. Two gems are the speech opposing a proposal to equalize wealth, and the case of a Cynic youth who has forsworn worldly goods but sues his father for cutting off his allowance.

Over forty of his plays were read in antiquity, from which nearly a thousand fragments survive. These provide a fuller picture of the poet's comic vitality and a wealth of information and insights about his world.bThe eleven plays by Aristophanes that have come down to us intact brilliantly illuminate the eventful period spanned by his forty-year career, beginning with the first production in 427 BCE. But the Athenians knew much more of his work: over forty plays by Aristophanes were read in antiquity, of which nearly a thousand fragments survive. These provide a fuller picture of the poet's ever astonishing comic vitality and a wealth of information and insights about his world. Jeffrey Henderson's new, widely acclaimed Loeb edition of Aristophanes is completed by this volume containing what survives from, and about, his lost plays, hitherto inaccessible to the nonspecialist, and incorporating the enormous scholarly advances that have been achieved in recent years. Each fragmentary play is prefaced by a summary of what can be inferred about its plot, characters, themes, theatricality, and topical significance. Also included in this edition are the ancient reports about Aristophanes' life, works, and influence on the later comic tradition.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aClassical literature. 0aGreek literature. 7aGreek drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)947136.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aGreecezAthens0(OCoLC)1204474.2fast1 aHenderson, Jeffrey,d1946-eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aAristophanes.tFragments.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2008z9780674996151 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v502.40uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL502/2008/volume.xml03416nam a22004814a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136035002100177040001200198041001800210050002300228072002300251072002300274072002300297100002400320245011500344260005400459300002200513490004000535500002000575520149200595538003602087546006002123588004702183650002902230650005102259650004802310650003802358650004402396650005902440650003502499700005402534700004102588776013402629830004102763856006502804856006502869hup0000604MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2008    mau    go     00| d eng d  z9780674996250q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674996311q(v. 2)qprint version  a(OCoLC)608097225  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3612b.E975 2014 7aDRA0060002bisacsh 7aHIS0020102bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh0 aEuripides,eauthor.10aFragmentsh[electronic resource] /cEuripides ; edited and translated by Christopher Collard and Martin Cropp.  aCambridge, MA :bHarvard University Press,c2014.  a1 online resource1 aLoeb Classical Library ; v504, 506  aIncludes index.  aEuripides (c. 485-406 BCE) has been prized in every age for his emotional and intellectual drama. Eighteen of his ninety or so plays survive complete, including Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae, one of the great masterpieces of the tragic genre. Fragments of his lost plays also survive.bEighteen of the ninety or so plays composed by Euripides between 455 and 406 bce survive in a complete form and are included in the preceding six volumes of the Loeb Euripides. A further fifty-two tragedies and eleven satyr plays, including a few of disputed authorship, are known from ancient quotations and references and from numerous papyri discovered since 1880. No more than one-fifth of any play is represented, but many can be reconstructed with some accuracy in outline, and many of the fragments are striking in themselves. The extant plays and the fragments together make Euripides by far the best known of the classic Greek tragedians. This edition, in a projected two volumes, offers the first complete English translation of the fragments together with a selection of testimonia bearing on the content of the plays. The texts are based on the recent comprehensive edition of R. Kannicht. A general Introduction discusses the evidence for the lost plays. Each play is prefaced by a select bibliography and an introductory discussion of its mythical background, plot, and location of the fragments, general character, chronology, and impact on subsequent literary and artistic traditions.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMythology, GreekvDrama. 7aGreek drama (Satyr play)0(OCoLC)947144.2fast 7aGreek drama (Tragedy)0(OCoLC)947146.2fast 7aGreek drama0(OCoLC)947127.2fast 7aMythology, Greek0(OCoLC)1031804.2fast 7aMythology, Greek, in literature0(OCoLC)1031814.2fast 7aTragedy0(OCoLC)1154355.2fast1 aCollard, C.q(Christopher),eeditor,etranslator.1 aCropp, Martin,eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aEuripides.tFragments.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2008z9780674996250(v.1)z9780674996311(v.2) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v504, 506.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL504/2008/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL506/2009/volume.xml02675nam a22004574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020003300095035002100128040001200149041001800161050002300179072002300202072002300225245016900248260005400417300002200471490003500493504003700528520089500565538003601460546006001496588004701556650005801603650005501661650005201716650004901768650006301817700004301880740001401923740002601937740001701963740001501980740001601995776011002011830003602121856006002157hup0000608MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2010    mau    gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674996366qprint version  a(OCoLC)899735815  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aPA3622b.L544 2014 7aLCO0030002bisacsh 7aLIT0041902bisacsh00aHellenistic collectionh[electronic resource] : bPhilitas ; Alexander of Aetolia ; Hermesianax ; Euphorion ; Parthenius /cedited and translated by J.L.

Cast in the form of a dialogue, the Saturnalia treats subjects as diverse as the divinity of the Sun and the quirks of human digestion while showcasing Virgil as the master of all human knowledge from diction and rhetoric to philosophy and religion. The new Latin text is based on a refined understanding of the medieval tradition and improves on Willis's standard edition in nearly 300 places. The accompanying translation--only the second in English and the only one now in print--offers a clear and sprightly rendition of Macrobius's ornate Latin and is supplemented by ample annotation. A full introduction places the work in its cultural context and analyzes its construction, while indexes of names, subjects, and ancient works cited in both text and notes make the work more readily accessible than ever before.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aScipio,cAfricanus,dapproximately 236 B.C.-183 B.C.xIn literature.00aVirgilvPoetry.10aScipio Aemilianus, P.

For each poet and play there is an introduction, brief notes, and select bibliography. Also included is a selection of ancient testimonia to Old Comedy, nearly one hundred unattributed fragments (both book and papyri), and descriptions of twenty-five vase-paintings illustrating Old Comic scenes. The texts are based on the monumental edition of Kassel and Austin, updated to reflect the latest scholarship.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek drama (Comedy) 0aGreek drama (Comedy)xHistory and criticism. 0aLost literaturezGreece. 7aGreek drama (Comedy)0(OCoLC)947136.2fast 7aLost literature0(OCoLC)1002659.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast 0aGreek drama (Comedy)vTranslations into English.1 aStorey, Ian Christopher,d1946-eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:tFragments of old comedy.dCambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 2011z9780674996625(v.1)z9780674996632(v.2)z9780674996779(v.3) 0aLoeb Classical Library ; v513-515.403v.1uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL513/2011/volume.xml403v.2uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL514/2011/volume.xml403v.3uhttp://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL515/2011/volume.xml03075nam a22004574a 4500001001100000003000800011005001700019006001100036007000700047008004100054020004100095020004100136020004100177035002100218040001200239041001800251050002100269072002300290072002300313100002000336245011500356260005400471300003900525490003900564504002700603505006400630520115300694538003601847546006001883588004701943650005201990650003602042650005302078700004402131700004802175776015902223830004002382856006502422856006502487856006502552hup0000616MaCbHUP20150123152300.0m     o  dcr cn 141025s2011    maua   gob    00| 0 eng d  z9780674996526q(v. 1)qprint version  z9780674996793q(v. 2)qprint version  z9780674996809q(v. 3)qprint version  a(OCoLC)902696493  aMaCbHUP1 aengagrchgrc00aR126b.G354 2014 7aLIT0041902bisacsh 7aMED0810002bisacsh0 aGalen,eauthor.10aMethod of medicineh[electronic resource] /cGalen ; edited and translated by Ian Johnston and G.H.R.

Enlivening the detailed case studies are many theoretical and polemical discussions, acute social commentary, and personal reflections.bGalen of Pergamum (129-?199/216), physician to the court of the emperor Marcus Aurelius, was a philosopher, scientist, and medical historian, a theoretician and practitioner, who wrote forcefully and prolifically on an astonishing range of subjects and whose impact on later eras rivaled that of Aristotle. Galen synthesized the entirety of Greek medicine as a basis for his own doctrines and practice, which comprehensively embraced theory, practical knowledge, experiment, logic, and a deep understanding of human life and society. New to the Loeb Classical Library is Method of Medicine, a systematic and comprehensive account of the principles of treating injury and disease and one of Galen's greatest and most influential works. Enlivening the detailed case studies are many theoretical and polemical discussions, acute social commentary, and personal reflections.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aMedicine, Greek and RomanvEarly works to 1800. 7aMedicine0(OCoLC)1014893.2fast 7aMedicine, Greek and Roman0(OCoLC)1015251.2fast1 aHorsley, G.

Heroicus is a vineyard conversation about the beauty, continuing powers, and worship of the Homeric heroes. Gymnasticus is the sole surviving ancient treatise on sports, which reshapes conventional ideas about the athletic body.bIn the writings of Philostratus (ca. 170-ca. 250 CE), the renaissance of Greek literature in the second century CE reached its height. His Life of Apollonius of Tyana, Lives of the Sophists, and Imagines reconceive in different ways Greek religion, philosophy, and art in and for the world of the Roman Empire. In this volume, Heroicus and Gymnasticus, two works of equal creativity and sophistication, together with two brief Discourses (Dialexeis), complete the Loeb edition of his writings. Heroicus is a conversation in a vineyard amid ruins of the Protesilaus shrine (opposite Troy on the Hellespont), between a wise and devout vinedresser and an initially skeptical Phoenician sailor, about the beauty, continuing powers, and worship of the heroes. With information from his local hero, the vinedresser reveals unknown stories of the Trojan campaign especially featuring Protesilaus and Palamedes, and describes complex, miraculous, and violent rituals in the cults of Achilles. Gymnasticus is the sole surviving ancient treatise on sports. It reshapes conventional ideas about the athletic body and expertise of the athletic trainer and also explores the history of the Olympic Games and other major Greek athletic festivals, portraying them as distinctive venues for the display of knowledge.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aPhilostratus,cthe Athenian,dactive 2nd century-3rd centuryvTranslations into English.00aPhilostratus,cthe Athenian,dactive 2nd century-3rd century.00aProtesilausc(Mythological character) 0aDialogues, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aGymnasticsvEarly works to 1800. 0aGymnastics. 0aHero worshipzGreecevEarly works to 1800. 0aHero worshipzGreece. 0aHeroesvEarly works to 1800. 0aPhysical education and trainingvEarly works to 1800. 0aPhysical education and trainingzGreecevEarly works to 1800. 0aPhysical education and trainingzGreece. 0aProtesilaus (Greek mythology)vEarly works to 1800. 0aTrojan WarvEarly works to 1800. 7aDialogues, Greek0(OCoLC)892521.2fast 7aGymnastics0(OCoLC)949583.2fast 7aHeroes0(OCoLC)955558.2fast 7aPhysical education and training0(OCoLC)1062401.2fast 7aProtesilaus (Greek mythology)0(OCoLC)1079789.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast02aPhilostratus,cthe Athenian,dactive 2nd century-3rd century,eauthor.tGymnasticus.02aPhilostratus,cthe Athenian,dactive 2nd century-3rd century,eauthor.tDiscourses 1 and 2. 0aDialogues, GreekvTranslations into English.1 aKönig, Jason,eeditor,etranslator.1 aRusten, Jeffrey S.eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aPhilostratus, the Athenian, active 2nd century-3rd century.tHeroicus.

In this volume, John T. Ramsey has freshly edited the Histories and the two pseudo-Sallustian Letters to Caesar, completing the Loeb Classical Library edition of his works.bSallust, Gaius Sallustius Crispus (86-35 BCE), a Sabine from Amiternum, acted as tribune against Cicero and Milo in 52, joined Caesar after being expelled from the Senate in 50, was restored to the Senate by Caesar and took part in his African campaign as praetor in 46, and was then appointed governor of New Africa (Numidia). Upon his return to Rome he narrowly escaped conviction for malfeasance in office, retired from public life, and took up historiography. Sallust's last work, the annalistic Histories in five books, is much more expansive than his monographs on Catiline and Jugurtha (LCL 116), treating the whole of Roman history at home and abroad in the post-Sullan age. Although fragmentary, it provides invaluable information and insight about a crucial period of history spanning the period from 78 to around 67 BCE. Although Sallust is decidedly unsubtle and partisan in analyzing people and events, his works are important and significantly influenced later historians, notably Tacitus. Taking Thucydides as his model but building on Roman stylistic and rhetorical traditions, Sallust achieved a distinctive style, concentrated and arresting; lively characterizations, especially in the speeches; and skill at using particular episodes to illustrate large general themes. For this volume, which completes the Loeb Classical Library edition of Sallust's works, John T. Ramsey has freshly edited the Histories and the two pseudo-Sallustian Letters to Caesar, supplying ample annotation.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Latin with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aHistorianszRome. 0aLatin literaturevTranslations into English. 7aRome (Empire)0(OCoLC)1204885.2fast02aSallust,d86 B.C.-34 B.C.eauthor.tLetters to Caesar.1 aRamsey, J.

The present edition of his work, along with that of his successors Moschus (fl. mid-second century BCE) and Bion (fl. around 100 BCE), replaces the earlier Loeb Classical Library volume of Greek Bucolic Poets by J. M. Edmonds (1912).bTheocritus (early third century BCE), born in Syracuse and also active on Cos and at Alexandria, was the inventor of the bucolic genre. Like his contemporary Callimachus, Theocritus was a learned poet who followed the aesthetic, developed a generation earlier by Philitas of Cos (LCL 508), of refashioning traditional literary forms in original ways through tightly organized and highly polished work on a small scale (thus the traditional generic title Idylls: "little forms"). Although Theocritus composed in a variety of genres or generic combinations, including encomium, epigram, hymn, mime, and epyllion, he is best known for the poems set in the countryside, mostly dialogues or song-contests, that combine lyric tone with epic meter and the Doric dialect of his native Sicily to create an idealized and evocatively described pastoral landscape, whose lovelorn inhabitants, presided over by the Nymphs, Pan, and Priapus, use song as a natural mode of expression. The bucolic/pastoral genre was developed by the second and third members of the Greek bucolic canon, Moschus (fl. mid second century BCE, also from Syracuse) and Bion (fl. some fifty years later, from Phlossa near Smyrna), and remained vital through Greco-Roman antiquity and into the modern era. This edition of Theocritus, Moschus, and Bion, together with the so-called "pattern poems" included in the bucolic tradition, replaces the earlier Loeb Classical Library edition by J. M. Edmonds (1912), using the critical texts of Gow (1952) and Gallavotti (1993) as a base and providing a fresh translation with ample annotation.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record. 0aGreek poetryxTranslations into English. 0aPastoral poetry, Greek. 7aCountry life0(OCoLC)881405.2fast 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 7aGreek poetry, Hellenistic0(OCoLC)947510.2fast 7aPastoral poetry, Greek0(OCoLC)1054648.2fast 7aGreece0(OCoLC)1208380.2fast0 aMoschus,eauthor.0 aBion,cof Phlossa near Smyrna,eauthor.1 aHopkinson, Neil,d1957-eeditor,etranslator.08iPrint version:aTheocritus.tTheocritus.

Paton, with a Greek text and ample notes reflecting current scholarship.bThe Greek Anthology contains some 4,500 short Greek poems in the sparkling and diverse genre of epigram, written by more than a hundred poets and collected over many centuries. To the original collection, called The Garland (Stephanus) by its contributing editor, Meleager of Gadara (first century BCE), was added another Garland by Philip of Thessalonica (mid-first century CE) and then a Cycle by Agathias of Myrina (567/568 CE). In about 900 CE these collections (now lost) and perhaps others (also lost, by Rufinus, Diogenianus, Strato, and Palladas) were partly incorporated and arranged into fifteen books according to subject by Constantine Cephalas; most of his collection is preserved in a manuscript called the Palatine Anthology. A second manuscript, the Planudean Anthology made by Maximus Planudes in 1301, contains additional epigrams omitted by Cephalas. Outstanding among the poets are Meleager, Antipater of Sidon, Crinagoras, Palladas, Agathias, and Paulus Silentiarius. This Loeb edition of The Greek Anthology replaces the earlier edition by W. R. Paton, with a Greek text and ample notes reflecting current scholarship. Volume I contains the following books: 1. Christian Epigrams; 2. Description of the Statues in the Gymnasium of Zeuxippus; 3. Epigrams in the Temple of Apollonis at Cyzicus; 4. Prefaces to Various Anthologies; and 5. Erotic Epigrams.  aMode of access: World Wide Web.  aText in Greek with English translation on facing pages.  aDescription based on print version record.00aGreek anthology. 0aEpigrams, GreekxHistory and criticism. 0aGreek poetryvTranslations into English. 0aGreek poetryvTranslations. 0aGreek poetry. 7aGreek poetry0(OCoLC)947503.2fast 0aEpigrams, GreekvTranslations into English. 0aEpigrams, Greek.1 aPaton, W.

Here the poet congratulates friends, consoles mourners, offers thanks, admires a monument or artistic object, and describes a memorable scene. The verse is light in touch, with a distinct pictorial quality. Statius gives us in these impromptu poems clear images of Domitian's Rome. Statius was raised in the Greek cultural milieu of the Bay of Naples, and his Greek literary education lends a sophisticated veneer to his ornamental verse. The role of the emperor and the imperial circle in determining taste is also readily apparent: the figure of the emperor Domitian permeates these poems. D. R.
